 Humansdorp - A 35-year-old Storms River man, who evaded arrest for almost six months, was finally arrested by a dedicated SAPS tracing team with the assistance of the local community. "The suspect was arrested at about 03:30 on Sunday morning, outside a residence in Storms River Village," said police spokesperson, Captain Gerda Swart. "The 35-year-old man was sought by police on charges ranging from burglary to rape." She said that it is alleged that the suspect broke into a residence on 20 December 2018 in the Storms River area and stole a television set that was recovered broken in the bushes later the same day. "The suspect was also on the run after he allegedly raped a 16-year-old woman in the bushes, close to Storms River, between 14 and 20 December 2018," Capt Swart said. "The suspect, who was out on specific parole conditions on a previous 2010 rape case, will now face a third charge of absconding after a case was registered in May 2019. "The suspect is due to appear in the Storms River Magistrate's Court on Tuesday on the said charges." Humansdorp Cluster Commander, Brigadier John Lebok commended the police officers for the efficient work and thanked the community for providing valuable information that led to the apprehension of the suspect. "Anyone who has information about crime and contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111. Callers may remain anonymous and all information will be treated with the strictest confidentiality."
