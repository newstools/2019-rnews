 Ngqamakhwe - Ngqamakhwe police are investigating a homicide case in which a woman was fatally shot under mystery circumstances. "It is alleged that two men arrived at the homestead of a 60-year-old woman at Mzantsi Locality, Mantunzeleni Village, Ngqamakhwe on Sunday, at about 19h30," described police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha. "The two men pretended as if they wanted a room to rent as there are there some flats at the homestead of the 60-year-old woman, which are rented by tenants." He said that the two men requested to speak to the woman outside the house. "Once they were outside the house, one of them pulled out his firearm and fatally shot the woman.
