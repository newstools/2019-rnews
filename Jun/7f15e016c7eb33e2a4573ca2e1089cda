 Port Elizabeth - A 23-year-old Arcadia man is expected in court after he was arrested by Port Elizabeth police, who responded to a shooting incident in the area on Friday night. "It is alleged that on Friday evening, at about 23:45, members of the Visible Gang Intervention Team (VGIT) were searching a sports bar in Bakkiesbom Street when they saw the suspect running to the back of the bar," described police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "The police officers ran after him and noticed him throwing something out through the security gate. "Members found a Z88 pistol and a .38 revolver in the yard. The suspect was arrested." Col Naidu said that investigations revealed that the 9mm pistol belonged to a Sergeant, who was robbed of his firearm and vehicle in KwaNobuhle early this month. "The revolver belongs to East Cape Gun Traders in Walmer." She said that the suspect was detained on charges of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. He will appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court on Monday. Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
