 Aliwal North - The swift reaction of a joint task team comprising of members of Crime Intelligence and K9 led to the successful arrest of two suspects, aged 37 and 20, on Monday morning at 10:00. "The intelligence received led the SAPS to wait for the suspected vehicle. "As the white Ford Kuga crossed the bridge into the Eastern Cape, the vehicle was stopped by the members in Barkly Street," said police spokesperson, Capt Ursula Roelofse. "On closer investigation and with the help of our four legged K9 friends, drugs were found in plastic bags under the driver's seat. "An amount of 1536 mandrax tablets were confiscated with an estimated street value of R 153 600.00." She said that this is one of the biggest bust in Aliwal North this year and it is alleged that the supplies are being fetched from the Free State side. "The two suspects will appear in the Aliwal North Magistrate's Court on Tuesday for possession of drugs." Deputy Cluster Commander, Col Mpho Rabela, has both welcomed and applauded the arrest of these notorious drug dealers of Aliwal North. He praised the team for the sterling work they have done in this case firstly for the arrest and secondly for their persistence as they did not rest until they managed to arrest these culprits so they can bring them to book. "Thank you to a community that said 'enough is enough we will work together with the SAPS to ensure our children are safe against drug abuse'."
