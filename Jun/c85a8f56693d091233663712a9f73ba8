 Port Elizabeth - Reaching out to the poor and destitute is surely a blessing; the SAPS Kabega Park partnered for the second year with the People Opposed to Poverty in Society Foundation (POPS) and on Saturday visited the Ericadene Informal Settlement. "There, they brought smiles to the faces of 45 families. Warm clothing, blankets and food parcels were handed down to these families as they prepare for the cold winter nights," said police spokesprson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "Many people living in impoverished conditions are struck by personal or debilitating physical circumstances and by giving our time, support and compassion we can definitely make a difference in the life of the less fortunate." She said that this community was surprised by this unexpected gesture and the children loved the interaction between POPS and the SAPS. "Well done to SAPS Kabega Park in fostering such relationships with NGO’s in bringing change and hope to the communities they serve." ‘No act of kindness no matter how small is ever wasted.’ AESOP Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
