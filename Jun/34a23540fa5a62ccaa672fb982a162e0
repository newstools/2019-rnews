 Humansdorp - Humansdorp police on Tuesday welcomed the two-year jail sentence imposed on a 32-year-old man, who was convicted of housebreaking and theft in the Storms River Magistrate’s Court. Humansdorp Cluster Commander, Brigadier John Lebok welcomed the sentence imposed by the presiding magistrate, Jakobus Richter, on Christo Goeda (32) for breaking and stealing inside a police station in Storms River on 23 May this year. On that day, at about 12:50am, a member working at the Community Service Centre spotted someone on the CCTV monitor scaling a boundary fence at the back of the police station and immediately summoned other colleagues for assistance. "It is said that the suspect forced open a window and entered one of the offices in the administration block," described police spokesperson, Sergeant Majola Nkohli, then. "It is said that a suspect was arrested inside the office busy disconnecting a computer." Capt Nkohli said that police also recovered two memory sticks inside his pocket. "A preliminary investigation has revealed that the memory sticks belong to a member, who works at the police station," he said. Goeda pleaded guilty to the charges of housebreaking and theft. Brig Lebok said; “I believe that this sentence is going to serve as deterrent to anyone, who may attempt to commit a similar incident."
