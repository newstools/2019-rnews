 Jeffreys Bay - Former African National Congress (ANC) Councillor in the Kouga Local Municipality, Phumzile Oliphant, says the Kouga Local Municipality's 2019/2020 budget is 'anti-poor'. Last week, Kouga Local Municipality Exexecutive Mayor, Horatio Hendricks, tabled a budget with several big service delivery projects that will be funded through the Kouga Local Municipality’s capital budget in the 2019/2020 financial year. "The budget is skewed and anti poor it's pro afluent and rich white communities of Kouga the ANC-led wards are penalized," Oliphant told RNEWS. "Our people are living in squalor conditions - the DA led council is not focussing in improving the lives of the downtrodden. "The capital budget is quiet when it comes to the black people. "Our people are suffering under the DA in Kouga!" Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook. For news on the Western Cape click here.
