 Cookhouse - The Cookhouse Visible Policing Unit reacted on information received from a source about a large shipment of mandrax tablets, which were being transported from Port Elizabeth by a minibus taxi, destined for Somerset-East. "A vehicle check point was conducted by Cookhouse visible police members and a minor, aged 10 years old, was found in possession of 500 Mandrax tablets," said police spokesperson, Captain Lariane Jonker. "The tablets were concealed in a school bag and have an estimated street value of R30 000.00." She said that the minor was dealt with in terms of the Child Justice Act and released into the care of his parents. Commander of the Cradock SAPS Cluster, Brigadier Madoda Zamkana, expressed his shock at the news of the incident. He said that parents should be actively involved in all activities of their children, because children are targeted by ruthless drug dealers to transport illicit drugs, to prevent adult conviction and sentencing.
