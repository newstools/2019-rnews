 Cambridge - The Mdantsane SAPS Cluster Commander, Major General Henry Vos, has issued a stern warning on licensed firearm-owners to take their licenses seriously. "This is after police received information that a 15-year-old boy died of gunshot wound at a local hospital on Saturday," said police spokesperson, Captain Mluleki Mbi. "It is alleged that three boys of the same age were playing inside the house at NU2, Mdantsane, outside East London, on 28 May 2019. "According to information, it is said that the boy went to the other room and came back with the firearm and they started playing with it when a shot went off hitting the victim on the buttocks." Capt Mbi said that he was rushed to hospital, but the family never notified the police about this incident. "Initial investigation shows that the safe key was easily accessible to the child and the safe was not mounted on the wall." A case of failure to safeguard a firearm and an inquest docket are now under investigation by police.
