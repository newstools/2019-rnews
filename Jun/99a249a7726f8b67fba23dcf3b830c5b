 Port Alfred - An alleged 23-year-old Port Alfred thief thought it's time he acquired two time pieces and a cellphone, but left a trail that led police straight to his house. "This happened after two rented homes were broken into and personal belongings stolen. Among the stolen items were cellphones and Fossil wrist watches," said police spokesperson, Capt Khaya Tonjeni. He said that Port Alfred SAPS were contacted and the matter reported. "Members on duty responded and began tracing the missing phone to a close-by house in Dove lane," Capt Tonjeni said. "Upon arrival at the house, they found a known suspect lying in bed. "Police dialled the number of the missing cellphone and it rang underneath the mattress the suspect was lying on. "On further search, two Fossil watches and another cellphone were found in the possession of the suspect. "It was then police discovered that another rented room nearer to the first victim had also been broken into and a cellphone and Fossil watches stolen." Capt Tonjeni said that the 23-year-old suspect was charged for housebreaking and theft. "He is expected to appear at Port Alfred Magistrate's Court on Monday facing respective charges."
