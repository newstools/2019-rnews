 Ntabankulu - Police in Ntabankulu arrested four males in their twenties for the alleged murder of a 23-year-old male during a drunken brawl. "The incident occurred next to Dumsi initiation school in Ntabankulu," described police spokesperson, W/O Zilungile Nkamba. "It is alleged that a group of young men were drunk and they had a fight. The deceased got injured and was rushed to a local hospital where he later died. "The suspects will appear before the court soon facing a murder charge." In another incident, police in Mbizana are investigating an inquest where a 17-year-old initiate died after he was circumcised last week Thursday. "The deceased allegedly went to the initiation school without the permission of his parents. He got sick and was admitted to the local hospital where he died on Sunday," sai W/O Nkamba. "Police are on the the heels of a suspect in this case and an arrest is eminent." Brigadier Mtutuzeli Mtukushe appealed to the communities of the Mount Ayliff Cluster to be highly involved in the lives of their children by sharing valuable information about circumcision and report incidents to the police. "Relevant institutions must be utilized concerning circumcision and a strict monitoring by adult males, giving guidance to young males during this period will be of best practice," he added. "The abuse of drugs and liquor resulting to these unnecessary deaths of youth is highly condemned."
