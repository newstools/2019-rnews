 Port Alfred - Offenders and those who are planning to commit crimes in Port Alfred should beware as the SAPS and local law enforcement have reinforced their bond to root out criminals in the area. On Tuesday, two well-known felons, who were on parole for housebreaking, were nabbed through the teamwork of local security companies and the SAPS. "The suspects in their early 20's were arrested between 12:30 and 13:30 on Tuesday and face charges of possession of suspected stolen property," said police spokesperson, Captain Mali Govender. "The door frame and a bush cutter which was recovered has already been linked to two unrelated burglary cases in Port Alfred. "Both suspects will appear in the local magistrate's court later this week." Port Alfred SAPS Cluster Commander, Brigadier Morgan Govender, praised the team for their swift action. "Criminals be warned that our law enforcement officers have teamed up with local security companies to follow and hunt you down. Every effort is being made to get rid of criminal elements. I urge the community to come forth and share information on crime that is taking place within the community," he said.
