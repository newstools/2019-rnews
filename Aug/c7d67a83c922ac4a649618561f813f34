 Queenstown - A very successful multidisciplinary SAPS operation resulted in the seizure of dagga worth an estimated R12,8 million in Queenstown and the arrest of a 32-year-old suspect. "The combined forces included the Aliwal North and Queenstown units from Crime Intelligence, K9 (dog unit) and members from the Clusters operational command centres, who followed up positive information on Sunday, at 20:00, on the R56 between Dordrecht and Molteno," described police spokeperson, Capt Ursula Roelofse. "A white Toyota Quantum and trailer was stopped and searched where the 57 bags of dagga with a weight of 512,12kg and an estimated street value of R12 800 000-00 was confiscated and the suspect arrested for dealing in dagga." Capt Roelofse said that the suspect would appear in the Dordrecht Magistrate's Court on Monday. "It is alleged that the 'skunk' dagga, as it is also known because of it's high value, was loaded at Lusikisiki and on the route to the Western Cape," she added. Capt Roelofse added that the different SAPS Cluster Commanders of Aliwal North, Queenstown and Elliot celebrated the successes and commended the combined forces on this excellent drug bust. "Members worked together across Cluster boundaries and each contributed with their own units expertise to make the success possible and to reach our goal and that is to fight crime," she said. "The message is clear, small towns can not be used as a route to transport dagga it will not be tolerated by committed and dedicated members of the SAPS."
