 Makhanda - The African National Congress (ANC) is expected to address the media in Makhanda after winning a by-election held in the town on Wednesday. The by-elction was contested by three candidates, Mzobanzi Nkwentsha from the African National Congress (ANC), Angela Peta Jones from the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Simphiwe Mbonda from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). The ward was previously represented by the DA and became vacant as a result of the councillor’s resignation. "We took this Ward from the DA. Congratulations to the new Ward Councillor," the party said. "We want to thank the people of Ward 12 in Makana for the confidence they have shown to the ANC. "They will not be disappointed for having made the right choice by putting the ANC first. "This and other recent successes are just a beginning of the process of the ANC intensifying its role of leading society." The ANC said that it will now intensify its effort to engage all constituencies with a view to accelerate service delivery and transformation.
