 Bhisho - Following its victory in Wednesday's ward by-election, the Democratic Alliance (DA) says residents of Ward 10 in the Enoch Mgijima Local Municipality have reaffirmed their trust in the DA. "The party retained the ward following a hard fought by-election," said DA Eastern Cape leader, Nqaba Bhanga. "The DA’s candidate in the Enoch Mgijima Ward 10 by-election, Tokkie Deysel, emerged victorious and obtained 74% of the valid vote cast." He added that the DA’s support in ward 10 shows a massive increase and the party improved on the 46,75% share of the vote it achieved in the 2019 National and Provincial Elections. "This result is a resounding vote of confidence in the DA and the endorsement from the voters proves that the DA remains on track ahead of the 2021 local government elections and is poised to take over government in the Enoch Mgijima Municipality," Bhanga said. "It is also a clear indication that the community of Enoch Mgijima is tired of being neglected and ignored. "We are grateful to voters for giving us this mandate and we don’t take it lightly."
