 Port Elizabeth - The Nelson Mandela Bay Business Chamber on Tuesday said that it is very concerned by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Council’s continued failure to appoint key personnel to vacant positions, especially the position of Chief Financial Officer (CFO). "This is despite National Treasury having gone on record to say that the failure to appoint a permanent CFO, before the end of August 2019, would affect the approval of any roll over applications for unspent conditional grants," described Dr. Andrew Muir, Nelson Mandela Bay Business President. "Should this happen, it would place tremendous pressure on the Metro’s financial viability – leading to further non-performance on critical service delivery areas." Dr Muir said that the city’s political leadership needs to urgently fast-track this appointment, to avoid further dysfunction in the Metro. "All the role players need to recommit towards rebuilding the city and putting the best interests of its people first."
