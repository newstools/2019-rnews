 Port Elizabeth - The petrol price picture for September 2019 is not looking good. According to the latest petrol price prediction for September 2019 by the Automotive Association of South Africa, motorists are in for a hefty petrol and diesel price increase. This is after petrol prices increased in August 2019. Petrol prices in South Africa have increased for six out of eight months in 2019. "Weakness in the Rand is expected to drive fuel prices higher in September 2019," the AA said. "This is according to the unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund." It said that according to the figures, 95 octane will rise by ten cents a litre, and diesel by 25 cents. Illuminating paraffin is also expected to climb by 21 cents. "The only positive out of the latest figures is 93 octane which is showing a decrease of three cents a litre." The AA said that the average landed price of fuel dropped across the board during August. "If the Rand/US dollar exchange rate had remained flat, we could have been looking at a drop of up to 30 cents a litre for diesel and nearly 52 cents for petrol. Unfortunately, continuing Rand weakness means that prices will increase instead," the association described. "We are, again, emphasising the need for policy stability to provide protection for the Rand. There are encouraging noises coming from Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, but these must lead to concrete action. "Our concern is that an ever-weakening Rand robs motorists of the opportunity to benefit from lower oil prices."
