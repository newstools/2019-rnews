 Mthatha - According to the latest survey from the Franchise Association of South Africa (FASA), 39% of franchisors have businesses in Africa, outside South African borders. This is equivalent to 1 775 stores in the SA franchise population. Most of these franchises are found in the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, eSwatini, Lesotho and with growth noted in Ethiopia and Kenya. Riaan Fouche, Chief Operating Officer for Franchising at FNB Business says, “More than 90% of franchise businesses in Africa are homegrown South African brands. There is huge appetite for bigger franchise brands in the retail, fuel and fast food sectors.” He unpacks factors to consider before expanding a franchise to the rest of Africa: “Before expanding your franchise it’s important to clearly define and understand the competitive advantage that will make your brand successful in-country. Lastly, you must be in this for the long haul as success will certainly not be achieved over night,” concludes Fouche.
