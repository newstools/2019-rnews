 Port Alfred - The Regional Court Port Alfred sentenced Bongani Sibejele, aged 26, and Siphosihle Leyi, aged 24, for a robbery  nearly two years ago. "On 3 September 2017, at 03:04, the victim in his 30’s, was returning to his home from the tavern, when he was approached by two males, who asked him for a cigarette, and when he told them that he did not have any, the one male drew a knife demanding for his cell phone," said police spokesperson, Captain Mali Govender. "The victim started to run and lost his balance and fell, at which stage the perpetrators snapped this opportunity and overpowered him. "They took his cellphone and an amount of cash that was in in possession and fled the scene. "Shortly after the report was made to the SAPS, information was followed up which led to the arrest of the two suspects." Port Alfred SAPS Cluster Commander, Brigadier Morgan Govender, commended the arresting officer, Cst Thobani Gobizembe, for his speedy response and the investigating officer, Detective Sergeant Jacques Scheepers, for ensuring the successful conviction of these two criminals, who have been terrorising the community.
