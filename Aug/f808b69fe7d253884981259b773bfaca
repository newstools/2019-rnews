 Johannesburg – Controversial CEO of African Global Operations (formerly Bosasa), Gavin Watson, reportedly died in a car accident on Monday morning. According to reports, the accident happened close to OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg at around 5am on Monday. "The man was driving into the airport precinct, when he allegedly lost control of his vehicle and collided with a concrete pillar holding up a highway bridge,” said a police statement on the crash. “The victim was certified dead on the scene by paramedics and a case of culpable homicide has been opened for investigation.” While the police did not reveal the name of the deceased, reports have since identified the deceased as Gavin Watson. Reports say Bosasa executives rushed to the scene of the accident near the airport, where a Bosasa Toyota Corolla had collided with a concrete pillar. Watson made headlines when he was implicated by former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi, for bribing government officials – including some Ministers, with money and other lavish gifts in exchange for favours. Agrizzi was testifying at the Zondo Commission into State Capture. Bosasa also allegedly donated millions to the African National Congress (ANC). The Bosasa scandal also roped in President Cyril Ramaphosa's son, Andile. However, Ramaphosa has insisted that his son is innocent of any wrongdoing.
