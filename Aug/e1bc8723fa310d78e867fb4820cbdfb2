 Butterworth - A 28-year-old man, Nkosinathi Wolela, appeared in absentia on Wednesday at the Butterworth Magistrate's Court for his alleged involvement in a cash-in-transit heist, which occurred on Monday at a Butterworth business. "At approximately 14:30 on Monday, G4S security guards were collecting money at a local store in Butterworth," described police spokesperson, Captain Anelisa Ngcakani. "One of the guards reportedly exited the store carrying a cash box and walked towards the armored vehicle. "Upon reaching the vehicle, he was allegedly confronted by two armed men, who threatened him with firearms before they forcefully took the money and fled the scene on foot." It is further alleged that as the second guard exited the store, he was also confronted by two armed suspects including Wolela, who reportedly tried to disarm the guard. "A struggle ensued for the guard's firearm and the guard managed to shoot and wound Wolela, who was consequently arrested at the scene by the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation unit assisted by the local police," said Captain Ngcakani. "The other suspects managed to get away, whilst Wolela is detained at a medical facility under police guard." His case has been postponed to the 4th of September pending further investigations by the Hawks.
