 Police in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday morning advised motorists to not make use of the Addo Road (R335) near Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, because of a violent service delivery protest. The R335 is a Regional Route that connects Port Elizabeth - through Motherwell, in the south to Somerset East to the north via Addo. According to police information, the protest is happening between the crossings of Mako Road and the M17. The protest saw the road being blocked off with burning tyres and rubble. The protestors were also reportedly pelting passing vehicles with stones. Local Public Order Policing units are monitoring the situation. Meanwhile Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Mongameli Bobani, is expected to address the protestors soon. The purpose is to give feedback following protests about electricity and water a few weeks ago. At the time, the Mayor promised to give feedback by the 13th of March. The Mayor's office has also been informed that currently there is also service delivery protest in the same area, where he will address residents. In 2018, Municipal IQ Municipal Hotspots Monitor said that service delivery protests reached an all-time annual record. At the end of September 2018, there had been 198 protests against a previous record of 191 in 2014 - and this excludes the last quarter of 2018. Kevin Allan, M.D. of Municipal IQ argues that: “Service delivery protests have become a daily feature of South African life with an alarming increase in violent confrontations between protesters and police. "As a result, the opportunity for communities to engage constructively on grievances is lost and municipalities need to work to ensure that channels for such communication remain accessible and relevant.” Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
