 Port Elizabeth – Eskom on Saturday morning announced that they will be implementing Stage 1 rational load shedding. Stage 2 load shedding will be taking place from 9h00 until 23h00 on Saturday due to shortage of capacity. “Eskom is currently implementing Stage 1 rotational load shedding. Stage 2 will be implemented from 09h00 and will continue until 23h00 today,” said Eskom on Twitter.  It again said that its maintenance teams are working round the clock to return generation units to the electricity system. Stage 2 calls for 2000MW, Stage 3 calls for 3000MW, and Stage 4 calls for 4000MW to be rotationally loadshed nationally at a given period. "We appeal to customers to switch off geysers during the day as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand. Remember to treat all electrical points as live during loadshedding," Eskom said. "Customers are advised to keep checking their loadshedding schedules on the Eskom or their municipal websites. For Eskom customers, these schedules are available on the Eskom website (http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za). Eskom customers can also contact our customer contact centre at 0860 037 566."
