 The power utility says the risk of loadshedding remains high as their system is still light and vulnerable. Eskom says that there is a high risk of rotational loadshedding on Wednesday, however it will be implemented if there are no other means to prevent it from happening. Eskom released a statement on Wednesday morning after they warned that there might be loadshedding on Tuesday, however that didn't happen. They said that the risk of loadshedding remains high as their system is still light and vulnerable. "Loadshedding will only be implemented if absolutely necessary." "We continue to encourage residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period," Eskom said. "Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand. "Customers are advised to keep checking their loadshedding schedules on the Eskom or Municipality website, and plan on the assumption that loadshedding will take place."
