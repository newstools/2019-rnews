 After their first successful speed marketing event in January, the newly formed iBhayi Small Business Chamber hosted their first networking event on the 19th of February at the Port Elizabeth Golf Club. Many small business owners in Port Elizabeth were in attendance to meet and create connections with each other and to learn about the progress the chamber has made since its creation. The iBhayi Small Business Chamber was created in November 2018 for the benefit of small businesses in the Nelson Mandela Bay area. The chamber aims to help improve local businesses and provide a collective group of people with their own experiences who can help each other grow and succeed.  Not only was this the iBhayi Small Business Chambers first networking event of the year, it was also a chance for the new members of the chamber to come advertise their business and receive their official plaque as members of the chamber. “I welcome you to this business networking event this evening. It is a very special opportunity to get to know each other, market and punt your business and to help develop the economy,” said Vice President of the iBhayi Small Business Chamber, Gaynor Bronkhurst. “We have been very busy behind the scenes. As a new business chamber we had to determine our vision and our direction which we now have. We are also affiliated with the small business institute and we have connections on a national and provincial level,” explained Gaynor. As the main sponsors of the iBhayi Small Business Chamber, Nedbank gave tips and advice to the small businesses at the networking event on how to better handle their finances and banking when it comes to running a business.
