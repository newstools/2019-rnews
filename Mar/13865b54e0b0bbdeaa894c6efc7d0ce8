 New Brighton – Members of the South African Police Service have been praised after they swiftly arrested two smash-and-grab robbery suspects in New Brighton, Port Elizabeth, less than two hours after they allegedly committed the crime on Monday. According to police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, a 40-year-old male was driving with his red VW Polo in Sheya Kulati Drive, New Brighton, in Port Elizabeth, on Monday morning at 08:00, when a maroon Chev Cruze stopped in front of him. Two males allegedly got out of the Cruze and approached his vehicle. “One of the suspects then smashed the passenger side window of the Polo and grabbed a cell phone off the passenger seat," Capt Beetge said “A passing New Brighton police member in a police vehicle saw the incident and gave chase after the two suspects on foot. “After the suspects managed to avoid arrest, the police member was joined by other New Brighton police members and followed up on the incident searching for the suspects." He said that at around 10:00, the accused were tracked down and arrested in a house in Mendi Road where the stolen cell phone worth about R4 500 was also found in their possession. The suspects, aged 27 and 21, were charged with robbery and will be appearing before the New Brighton Magistrate's Court on Tuesday morning. “A very relieved complainant was full of praises about the swift police work and said the member that was first on the scene is his hero,” Captain Beetge said.
