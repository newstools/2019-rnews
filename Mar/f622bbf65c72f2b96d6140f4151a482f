 Port Elizabeth - A 33-year-old Port Elizabeth man survived being shot three times along Vuzi Street, in Joe Slovo West, Kwadwesi, Port Elizabeth, after he was attacked by armed suspects, who robbed him of his personal belongings, on Thursday. Police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, said that the man was rushed to a local hospital by family members following the attack. Captain Beetge said that three suspects fled from the scene with the man's belongings. Police have since managed to arrest two of them. Captain Beetge said that swift response by police resulted in the first arrest early on Friday morning of a 33-year-old male in Joe Slovo. “He is charged with attempted murder and house robbery," he said. “Further follow up led police to a house in Connacher Street, New Brighton, Port Elizabeth, where a 28-year-old suspect was also arrested." A 9mm pistol with a magazine and seven rounds of ammunition was confiscated after a search of the ceiling of the house. “The firearm was found with its serial number removed and will be sent for forensic and ballistic analysis," Capt Beetge said. “This suspect was charged for attempted murder, house robbery as well as the illegal possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition.” Meanwhile the Motherwell SAPS Cluster Commander applauded the swift arrests of the suspects and the recovery of an illegal firearm. He said: "The SAPS will continue to focus on unlicensed fire arms and the crimes committed using these fire arms. Our community must take a stand against these suspects and supply police with the information about them (suspects) and also about where these fire arms are kept." Both suspects will appear before the New Brighton Magistrate's Court on Monday to face the charges against them.
