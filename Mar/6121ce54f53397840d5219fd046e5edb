 Port Elizabeth - Police in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, have again warned residents against taking the law into their hands after a charred body of a 20-year-old man, Luzuko Simanga, from Motherwell NU9, on Friday morning. The police said that Simanga's charred body was found dumped behind a shack. According to police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, a family member alleged that Simanga was woken up at around 03:00 by a person suspected to have been known by the deceased. Simanga apparently left his home in Ngwevana Street (about 300 metres away from where he was found) with this person. "His burnt out body was found four hours later and the SAPS were alerted. "SAPS suspects that he was killed and his body set alight with burning tyres, after his attackers alledgedly suspected him of theft of power cables," Captain Beetge said. Motherwell SAPS Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, strongly condemned this killing. "Persons taking part in vigilante killings (mob justice) immediately become killers themselves," he warned. "Our community must refrain from taking the law into their own hands to commit assaults and murders on other persons or suspected criminals." Mob justice is a problem among communities, who often feel let down by the justice system. In February, again in Motherwell, police were alerted by the family of a 23-year-old man, who was abducted with another man, from his home in Mtanezulu Street, NU11, Motherwell, Port Elizabeth. He was later found murdered and his body set alight. Police said that they believe the mob justice incident was sparked by the murder of 60-year-old Ms Nomathemba Goliath, whose body was found on Thursday, at 07:00 in her house in Mbayisa Street, Shuku Shukuma.
