 Makhanda - Convicted drug mule, Nolubabalo ‘Babsie’ Nobanda, from Makhanda (formerly Grahamstown) is expected to land at the OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg on Thursday. Nobanda was arrested in 2011 at Thailand’s Suvarnabhumi Airport after she was busted with 1.5kg of cocaine stuffed in her artificial dreadlocks. Shelater told Thai officials she was supposed to make a delivery to a client at a Bangkok hotel. Nobanda pleaded guilty and her 30-year sentence was reduced to 15-years. She has been released after serving seven years of the 15-year sentence and will land at OR Tambo International Airport on Thursday.? While she was in the Thai prison, she prepared to become a productive member of society and received a degree from UNISA through distance learning. Her communication studies with UNISA enabled her to teach English to prison officials. At the same prison, she met another convicted South African drug smuggler from the Free State, Thando Pendu. Pendu returned to South Africa in June this year after serving 10 years in the Thai jail. Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
