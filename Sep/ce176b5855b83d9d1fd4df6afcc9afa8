 Port Elizabeth - The continuous theft of cables and solar panels from the Port Elizabeth Airport has prompted aviation authorities to seek urgent intervention from the South African Police Service. "It is alleged that in a matter of six weeks, approximately 28 solar panels were stolen from the airport," described police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "The theft of these panels poses a serious threat to communication between the aircrafts and tower control." She said that during the early hours of Thursday morning, at 02:15, the Port Elizabeth K9 unit responded to a complaint of theft in progress at Port Elizabeth Airport. "It is alleged that four suspects were busy cutting the fence to gain entrance to the airport. A description was given of the suspects, who after seeing the airport security, ran into the bushes." Col Naidu said that police officers tactically advanced into the bush and spotted the suspects. "After being warned several times to stop, Sgt Wallace Kettledas released his dog, Bentley. A 19-year-old teenager was arrested while the others managed to flee." She added that the suspect was detained on charges relating to the Aviation and Airport Security Related Issues Act 13 of 2009 and Malicious Damage to Property. "He is expected to appear in court soon." Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook. For news on the Western Cape click here.
