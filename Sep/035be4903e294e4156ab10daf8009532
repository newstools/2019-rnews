 Port Elizabeth - Some cloudy, cold and wet weather is expected to move in over the Eastern Cape overnight on Saturday into Sunday, the Port Elizabeth office of the South African Weather Service said on Thursday. "Rain is expected along the coast and adjacent interior up to the escarpment and possibly beyond," said Garth Sampson, SA Weather Service Client Liaison Officer in the Eastern Cape. "The area between St Francis and Port Elizabeth is expected to only receive around 5-10mm, but elsewhere in the region, models are indicating figures above 10mm. "This will include the drought stricken areas of Adelaide and Bedford." Sampson said that conditions will gradually clear from the west on Monday.
