 Mthatha - The Department of Water and Sanitation has spent R3.5 million to erect a fence around Lubisi Dam in Qamata, Cofimvaba, following the drowning of people and animals at the end of 2018 and the beginning of this year. "The construction of the fence started in August 2019 and it’s scheduled to be completed in January 2020," said Department of Water and Sanitation, Sputnik Ratau. "This is part of the effort by the department to curb drownings and secure water resources for the benefit of communities around Cofimvaba and surrounding areas. "There was negative publicity in the media about the drownings of both animals and residents at Lubisi Dam. "The department urges all citizens to refrain from stealing the fence and vandalising government infrastructure because it impacts negatively on communities."
