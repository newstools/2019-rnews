 East London - During the International Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation (IBBF) 2019 Bodybuilding Championships held at the Vodaworld, Midrand in Gauteng, SAPS Cambridge's Captain Steve Du Rand competed with over 300 participants with 17 countries from Asia, Africa and Europe in the over 50s division. He claimed 5th spot in this division, a position which rates him among the best in this sport. Du Rand started to prepare for the competition on August 2018. He said he had to change his lifestyle during the preparation period. "I had to change my diet to busmati rice and chicken or fish for the body to burn fat and I had to do cardio exercises for an hour in the morning and have an hour and a half or two for heavy training in the evening," said Du Rand. He also added that his wife and son gave him a lot of support. Du Rand said he believes that the SAPS benefits from them as all competitors from the SAPS team placed on the world cup won something, which shows that the police can stand at a world's stage. Du Rand's biggest joy is that he was able to burn his body fat and managed to be placed on 5th place on a big line up of body builders. The Cambridge station commander Brigadier Pumla Mdlankomo was full of praises for this veteran. "We pride ourselves on this feat achieved by Captain Du Rand, he is a motivation to all of us," she said.
