 East London - The instincts of alert Buffalo Flats Crime Prevention members paid off when they stopped and searched a 30-year-old male at Elephant Road, in East Bank, East London, on Monday. "It is alleged while patrolling the area, members came across of a male, who was riding a bicycle with a bag on his back," said police spokesperson, Captain Hazel Mqala. "They stopped him and asked permission to search him and his bag. "Upon searching him, they found a sachet of Tik weighing 0.04 grams and one dagga bompie weight 0.02 grams in his pocket." She said that they further searched his bag and a 9mm Vector Pistol was found with ten live ammunition. "The serial number of the firearm was scratched off. The suspect was arrested on charges of possession of drugs, possession of an unlicenced firearm and possession of ammunition." Acting Cluster Commander, Brigadier Kanuka, commended the members on their alertness and trusting their instincts. "The recovery of even one firearm is commended as these illegal firearms are used in the commissioning of crime and to terrorize community members," he said. The suspect will appear in the East London Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
