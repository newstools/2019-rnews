 East London - Twenty-seven out of 60 suspects that were arrested by East London police during operations in Mdantsane over the weekend were arrested for drunken driving. "Police and Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality traffic officers embarked on proactive crime prevention and held numerous roadblocks in and around the cluster," said police spokesperson, Capt Nkosikho Mzuku. "The other suspects, aged between 21 and 49 years, were arrested for crimes ranging from assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm, rape, reckless and negligent driving, burglary business, malicious damage to property, assault common, possession of tik, possession of mandrax, dealing in drugs, house robbery." He said that the authorities maintained high visibility at the following areas Mdantsane, Vulindlela, Inyibiba, Cambridge, Berlin, Macleantown, Bluewater, Komga, Mooiplaas and Kei Mouth policing precincts. "Drugs, dangerous weapons, including knives and scissors were confiscated from community members during stop and searches," Capt Mzuku said. "These dangerous weapons are normally used to commit serious crimes like murders and robberies. It is on that note that, we believe this operation was a great success, as it has prevented serious crimes like murders, robberies and unnecessary fatalities on our roads due to drivers driving under the influence of liquor.
