 East London - "If someone I know can do this to me, can I trust men again?" a rape survivor asked reacting to the 15-year jail sentence handed to her attacker by the Mdantsane Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. The 27-year-old woman was raped by Mzuvukile Langeni, whom she had known from the same neighborhood for years. Langeni was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for rape. "[On the fateful day] the woman was asked by Langeni to accompany him to get more cash from his house in the neighborhood, Potsdam, Inyibiba, as they were drinking together at a local tarven on 23 June 2018," said police spokesperson, Captain Nkosikho Mzuku. "The victim trusted Langeni and felt safe around him because they knew each other from the same neighborhood. "On arrival at the house, Langeni assaulted her and raped her." Mdantsane SAPS Cluster Commander, Major General Henry Vos, applauded the investigating officer Sergeant Luhadi. "A word of caution to women to be watchful of those who befriend them inside places of entertainment or even at parties, even if they are not strangers to them," he said.
