 Port Elizabeth - The combating of serious and violent crimes in the Northern Areas of Port Elizabeth is dependent on the confiscation and seizure of illegal firearms. "Thus, the Anti-Gang Unit operating in the hotspot areas have made significant strides since their inception in July 2019," said police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "To date, 66 firearms were confiscated and several arrests made." She said that the latest arrest was effected on Tuesday when members were conducting operations in Helenvale, Port Elizabeth. "It is alleged that at about 10:20, AGU members noticed two males standing in front of a house in Reynecke Street. One of the males pulled out a firearm and started running to the back of a house," Col Naidu described. "Members were in pursuit and succeeded in cornering the 27-year-old suspect in a toilet. "On searching the immediate vicinity, a 9mm pistol was found in an old washing machine. "The suspect was arrested and detained on a charge of illegal possession of a firearm."
