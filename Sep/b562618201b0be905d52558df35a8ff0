 Port Elizabeth - Three suspects are expected in court after they were arrested by Port Elizabeth K9 Unit members, with the assistance of their colleague ‘Max’, over an alleged hijacking that took place in William Slammert Drive in Ext 21 Bethelsdorp, Port Elizabeth. According to police information, at about 19:20, a 36-year-old Kwadwesi man was robbed at gunpoint of his white VW Golf in Mzwandile Street. "It is alleged that the complainant was stopped in the street by two men, who told him that they were going to Westville and they jumped into the car," said police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "The man was forced to drive and then ordered to stop and get off on a gravel road. The suspects drove off in the car." At about 20:10, Port Elizabeth K9 Unit members, after receiving information about the alleged hijacking, patrolled the main routes on the look-out for the vehicle. "The vehicle was spotted in William Slammert Drive. While the vehicle was still in motion, the left front passenger (aged 28) attempted to jump out of the vehicle." Col Naidu said that the police officers managed to stop the vehicle and as the passenger was running, he threw a firearm onto the grass. "When he refused to heed to several warnings to stop, ‘Max’ was released and the 28-year-old male was apprehended in an open field next to the road. Two other suspects, 19 and 24 years old were also arrested." The men were detained on charges of hijacking and possession of suspected stolen property. They are expected to appear in court soon.
