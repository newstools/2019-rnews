 East London - Valuable information shared with the police about an East London shop led to the discovery and seizure of counterfeit goods valued at more than R1 million. "It is alleged that on Wednesday last week, Sea Border members received information about a counterfeit shop in the East London area," said police sokesperson, Col Sibongile Soci. "The members immediately communicated with external role players including patent attorneys and South African Revenue Services for a joint operation and proceeded to raid the shop." The following goods with an estimated value of R1 062 120.00 were confiscated: "The confiscated goods were handed to officials from Customs and Excise for the safekeeping." Eastern Cape Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga commended the vigilant community member for sharing the information with the police. “Border Policing members continue to ensure that counterfeit goods are prevented from entering our shores and borders but it is through active police-public partnership that police can succeed in curbing the proliferation of these goods,” she said. "Fake and counterfeit products pose a serious risk to the country’s economy as South Africa loses tax revenue due to the illicit trade. The community is fervently urged to refrain from buying counterfeit goods and to report any suspicious behaviour to the police."
