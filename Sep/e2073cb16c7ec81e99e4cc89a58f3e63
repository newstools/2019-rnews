 Port Elizabeth - Nelson Mandela Bay Municipalities Executive Mayor, Mongameli Bobani urges residents to allow Municipal employees to deliver services to the communities safely as yet another attack took place on Friday, 27 September. A Sewerage Blockage team was attacked and robbed at gunpoint on Friday around 13H00 in Katyu street, Zwide. One of the four gentleman was badly injured and had to be hospitalized. They were robbed of their personal belongings. The assailants also stole working tools belonging to the Municipality. This is one of many attacks that have taken place. These criminal acts have resulted in service delivery teams refusing to go into various areas to render services to communities as they fear for their lives. This has a serious negative effect on service delivery areas, like fixing of water leaks, potholes, storm water drains and other infrastructure related work. "I would like to condemn violence on our officials who are often victims of crime whist rendering services in our communities, I call upon the public to protect Municipal workers who do service delivery work," said Bobani.. "I call upon you to work with the law enforcement agencies to make sure that these criminals are put behind bars."
