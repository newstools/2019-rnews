 Port Elizabeth - The now-famous police K9 dog, Jack, was hard at work again over the weekend tackling and arresting two robbery suspects in Algoa Park, Port Elizabeth. "It is alleged that on Saturday, at about 15:00, the Port Elizabeth K9 unit members were patrolling near the Kenako Mall in Algoa Park when they heard a woman screaming," said police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "When they stopped, a woman (in her 50’s) informed them that she was just robbed at the ATM of her cash and bank card and that the suspects fled in a white VW Polo. "The members headed off in search of the vehicle and not long after, they spotted it along Daku Street, in Kwazakele." She said that when the suspects spotted the police, the front passenger (the driver) jumped out and ran off. "When the driver made a dash for freedom after ignoring several warnings to stop, Jack was released and apprehended him. The back seated passenger also exited and started running, but Jack was soon on his heels and he too, was arrested." Col Naidu said that the complainant’s cash and bank card was found on one of the suspects. "The cash was found hidden in his shoes." Both suspects, aged 28 and 29 years old, were detained on a charge of robbery and are expected to appear in the New Brighton Magistrate's Court on Monday. "The vehicle which belongs to the driver’s mother was seized for further investigation." Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
