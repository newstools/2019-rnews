"Eskom communicated its summer plan on the 4th September 2019 at a media briefing held at Megawatt Park, where we indicated that while no loadshedding is expected over summer the risk however remains as the system is still tight and vulnerable, as we ramp up plant maintenance. "Following a statement by the Democratic Alliance’s regarding possible loadshedding, Eskom’s Acting Group Chief Executive Mr Jabu Mabuza is open to discuss details with Ms Mazzone." Eskom says it continues to encourage residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly.
