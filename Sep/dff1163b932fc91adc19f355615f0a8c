A mere 0.8 mm was measured during the 2019 winter. This is well below the average of 28.4 mm." Sampson said for Port Elizabeth the 98.3 mm for winter was not a record due to some nice falls in July. "However the 98.3 mm measured this year is well below the winter norm of 174.6 mm," he said. "For East London, it was neither a major record, but the 34.4 mm was considerably lower than the norm of 145.5 mm for winter." "Cradock experienced the highest average maximum for August 2019 (1990 -2019). The average maximum temperature for August was 23.7 mm."

"These include Queenstown at 20.9 C (1992-2019), Mthatha at 23.6 C (1996-2019), Cradock at 22.3 C (1990-2019) and Port Elizabeth at 21.9 C (1992-2019).
