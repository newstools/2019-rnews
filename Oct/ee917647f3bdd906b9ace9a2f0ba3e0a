 Mthatha - Communications Minister, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, over the weekend confirmed that her Mthatha home had been damaged by fire. "This morning [Sunday], I landed from Cairo and proceeded to Durban for the GovTech program," she said in a statement. "Upon landing in Durban, I then got the news that our home in Mthatha is on fire. "At this stage, we do not know what happened as there was no one in the house and we are now waiting for reports from the investigation. "At this juncture, we would not want to speculate as all of us were not there. We are deeply saddened but we trust our God will pull us through this and He will give us strength to build another home for our children." She thanked family, friends and loved ones for their outpour of love and concern; "and we know that our God has not forsaken us". Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams also slammed journalists for only seeing a story during the time of her misery.
