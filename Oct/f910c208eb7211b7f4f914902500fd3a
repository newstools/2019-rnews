 Bhisho - The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape wants the Eastern Cape Department of Education and the Eastern Cape Department of Social Development to introduce the 'No means No Worldwide' in schools citing its success in reducing rape and teen pregnancies in other countries. "This week I tabled a motionin the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature to address the surge of gender-based violence against women and children, through the adoption of the 'No Means No Worldwide' programme in Eastern Cape schools," said Yusuf Cassim (MPL), DA Eastern Cape Shadow MEC for Education. "There is clear evidence that violence in schools in the province, against learners and teachers, is on the increase. "There have been at least three fatalities on school premises with a further 79 learners and 49 teachers have been injured due to gang related violence in schools." Cassim said that this is unacceptable! "No child or teacher should fear being assaulted at school," he described. "No child should fear losing their life while seeking an education!" Cassim said that in Kenya, the 'No means No Worldwide' campaign was initiated in schools with results that showed: "Preventative programmes do play a key role in the fight against gender-based violence," he added. "Through this motion, the DA is calling on the Department of Education, together with the Department of Social Development, to implement the 'No means No Worldwide' programme in all schools in the Eastern Cape in the next academic year."
