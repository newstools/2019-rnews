 Aliwal North - Members of the Burgersdorp Visible Policing were busy with their crime prevention patrols in town on Thursday evening when they received positive information on drugs being transported and followed it up. "A taxi with passengers from Aliwal North on the way to Burgersdorp was then stopped outside town," said police spokesperson, Capt Ursula Roelofse. "The passengers were then searched and one person had concealed 100 mandrax tablets in a plastic bag in a take-away food container. "The 38-year-old suspect was arrested for possession of drugs and the 100 mandrax pills, with a street value of R10 000, were confiscated." The man will appear in the Burgersdorp Magistrate's Court on Friday. Aliwal North SAPS Deputy Cluster Commander, Col Mpho Rabela, commended the members on the swift reaction and send out a warning to all the perpertraters that our small towns will not tolerate this conduct and will not easily be used to distribute drugs.
