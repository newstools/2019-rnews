 Port Elizabeth - Eastern Cape SAPS Provincial Commissioner, Lt Gen Liziwe Ntshinga, has immediately implemented the 72-hour activation plan to hunt down the perpetrators allegedly involved in the shooting of a five-old-boy in Helenvale, Port Elizabeth, on Sunday evening. "It is alleged that on Sunday, at about 17:30, a 35-year-old male was sitting in Terblanche Street in Helenvale and the 5-year-old boy was not far from him when two males approached and started shooting at the 35-year-old male," said police spokesprson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "The adult male was shot in his hip and a stray bullet hit the child in his stomach. The suspects got into a white Hyundai vehicle and drove off. Both victims are in hospital." Col Naidu said that police are investigating two cases of attempted murder. Lt Gen Ntshinga has assigned a team of dedicated officers to immediately hunt down these suspects. "We will not tolerate such audacity from these criminals. We will be forcefully clamping down on this lawlessness and we will be asserting the authority of the state by vigorously implementing our operational strategies," added Lt Gen Ntshinga. "We cannot allow our innocent children to become victims, therefore I urge the communities not to protect these criminals but to expose them."
