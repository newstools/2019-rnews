 Bhisho - The Democratic Alliance in the Eastern Cape on Thursday moved a motion at the special sitting of the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature (Taking the Legislature to the People) in Komani, that the Enoch Mgijima Municipality be dissolved in terms of section 139 (1)(c) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. According to Vicky Knoetze (MPL), DA Eastern Cape Shadow MEC for COGTA, the Democratic Alliance believes that the Municipality has failed to meet its executive obligations in terms of the Constitution and legislation in that amongst other factors; "Frequent electricity outages, litter, failing infrastructure, water and sewerage leaks are all evidence of the complete collapse of service delivery in the municipality," she added. "These are the symptoms of the implosion of governance in Enoch Mgijima. The people from Komani has made it clear that enough is enough. "Therefore, the Democratic Alliance moved that the relevant provincial executive must intervene in terms of the Constitution and take the appropriate steps to ensure fulfillment of the obligation to the residents of Komani, by dissolving the Municipal Council."
