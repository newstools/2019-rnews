 Port Elizabeth - The Port Elizabeth SAPS' K9 buddies are proving to be very therapeutical to people with disabilities and mental problems. "The constant companionship of an animal has been shown to reduce feelings of loneliness in elderly care and nursing homes," said police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "Recently, the SAPS K9 and Mounted units have been invited by many frail care and nursing centres to provide displays or even just to interact with the elderly or sick." She said that on Wednesday, SAPS Humewood Women’s Network and the Port Elizabeth K9 unit visited the Home Sweet Home Frail Care Centre in St George’s Park. "Misty, the Search and Rescue dog stole the hearts of the wheelchair bound residents at the facility," Col Naidu said. "It would seem Misty just knew how to bring calm and peace to the patients who are suffering from debilitating illnesses. "After showing off her skills with her handler W/O Etienne Gerber, she didn’t mind a stroke or two from her audience." She added that the Women’s Network also treated the 53 patients to a lovely cup of tea and cake. "The SAPS is proud to contribute to the speedy recovery and development of people suffering with specific medical conditions."
