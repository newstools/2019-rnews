 King William's Town - Eastern Cape police on Thursday warned the public of a new scam that has seen people losing their money. "Police have picked up a new trend where people are conned of their money through e-Wallet transaction via their cellphones," said police spokesperson, Captain Mluleki Mbi. "This is after two men were in separate incidents approached by a group of three women posing as Vodacom agents in Vincent Park, East London, last week. "They approached them in pretense of wanting to assist them in viewing how much talking point and airtime they have on their phones as they are running a promotion." Capt Mbi said that after having handed over their cellphones to these ladies, the victims would later discover that money has been taken from their accounts via e-Wallet transaction. "We are currently investigating two cases of fraud and we wish to warn members of the public to always be vigilant, protect their cellphones and ATM cards to us assist us in reducing the number of fraud cases."
