 Jeffreys Bay - A public meeting will be held in Hankey this October to give the community a progress report on the local housing project. The meeting will take place at 7pm on Monday, 7 October, at the Vusumzi Landu Community Hall. Kouga Speaker Hattingh Bornman said a critical matter that will be discussed, is the relocation of households to the transit site. “The bush-clearing has been completed and the sub-division, popularly known as ‘pegging’, of the site where the houses will be built is under way,” he said. “Once the sub-division has been completed, the relocation will commence. “The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the details of the relocation, so that we can all work together to minimise the inconvenience to those affected by the move.” He said once the relocation had been completed, Eskom will start electrifying the plots that will form part of the Hankey housing project, as well as the transit site. “It was a long and tough negotiation to get a commitment from Eskom to electrify these areas. We look forward to bringing electricity to these households and improving their quality of life,” he said. Image: Bush-clearing has been completed at the site of the Hankey housing project.
