 Port Elizabeth - Mount Road police on Sunday said that they noted with concern the circulation on social media reports about an abandoned baby found at the Greenacres shopping mall, in Port Elizabeth, on Saturday. "According to the post, the child was found and taken to SAPS Mount Road and handed over to police," said police spokesperson, Capt Sandra Janse van Rensburg. "Police confirm that there were no such reports nor did anyone drop off any child. "Social media is a helpful medium for both the community and the police. "However, the hoaxes, fake news and the dissemination of false information sows panic among our communities, but also wastes the police's time and resources." She added that such misinformation is reckless, irresponsible and unacceptable. "Police is urging social media users to verify and confirm such information with them before posting and circulating thus avoiding the misinformation from going viral." Capt Janse van Rensburg said that the SAPS calls on all, who have published, seen or circulated the hoax to ignore it and to refrain from further sharing or disseminating false information.
