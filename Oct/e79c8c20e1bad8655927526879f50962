 East London - A moving ceremony, initiated by Men for Change to cleanse Voorpos Primary School, in Cambridge, East London, was performed on Tuesday. This followed an incident where Andiswa Zweni was shot and killed by her policeman husband, Zandisile Zweni, on the school premises in June last year. "In the opening prayer, Reverand Mpumelelo Qwabaza prayed for the family to heal," said police spokesperson, Captain Mluleki Mbi. "He also prayed for police officers as they deal with violence each and every day." Bishop Nopece performed the cleansing ceremony and prayed for the spirit of murder to come to an end. He also prayed for the teachers and children's protection. Various pastors prayed for the school, the police and matters that are faced by the country at large. Before she prayed, Prophetess Mkati said, "we are at war, gender based violence is a war that we have to fight." When passing acknowledgement, Deputy Provincial Commisioner for HRM (human resource management), Major General Thobeka Kunene thanked the Mcilongo family for allowing the police to work with them. "We are looking forward to working with you and assist where we can," said General Kunene. She added that the police go through a lot but through prayers they are going to win. The event was then closed with South African National Anthem by the SAPS band. Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
