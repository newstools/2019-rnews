 Port Elizabeth - Once again, alertness and intuition paid off when on Saturday evening, at about 23:10, members of the Port Elizabeth K9 unit, while patrolling in Kwazakele, noticed a VW Polo TSI speeding. "The vehicle was travelling between side streets," said police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "The vehicle was followed and members found it stationary in Boxongo Street with its lights on. "Just then, a gunshot was heard and back-up was requested." Col Naidu said that the members followed on foot in the direction of the gunshot and noticed a man in a yard in a side street. "The man then went to the VW Polo and got in." She said that the PE Flying Squad members tactically approached the vehicle and it was established that it was the same man that was in the yard. "A male was found lying in the nearby park with a gunshot wound to his forehead. A 9mm Norinco pistol was found in the yard," Col Naidu added. "The suspect, aged 32, was arrested and detained on a charge of murder. The serial number of the firearm is filed off. "Motive for the shooting is under investigation." She said that the Motherwell Serious and Violent Crimes Investigation Unit is investigating a case of murder. "The victim approx. 30-years-old has not yet been identified and police is appealing to anyone, who can assist in his identity to contact D/Capt Frank Van der Berg on 082 394 5957." Col Naidu added that it is suspected that the victim is from the area. Meanwhile, the suspect is expected to appear in court soon.
