"The misuse of liquor especially in the Walmer location is a stubborn social ill which often results in crimes such as murder, attempted murder, rape, assault and assault with intent to cause serious bodily harm." Col Naidu said that from Tuesday, from 16:00, until 07:00 on Wednesday morning, SAPS Walmer held an operation in the G-West area with special focus on clamping down on shebeens and illegal taverns.
