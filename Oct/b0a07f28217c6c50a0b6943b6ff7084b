 East London - Comair, which operates British Airways in South Africa and low cost airline, kulula.com, on Tuesday said that its grounded aircraft had now been released for flights. "We can confirm that four of the affected aircraft have been released back into service and we are expecting the full fleet to be back in operation by tomorrow morning," the company said. "The flight schedule has been amended for today and we are working tirelessly to normalise the schedule and minimise disruption for our customers." Early on, Comair had said that it expected disruptions to flights after some of its aircraft were grounded by the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) over irregular findings picked up during a recent audit of its maintenance and technical service provider, South African Airways Technical (SAAT). "At of 10:15, this morning, a third of Comair’s services have been affected due to the notice received from the SACAA," it described. "We are continuously updating our contingency plans and communicating with our customers by SMS, however to avoid unnecessary frustration, customers can check revised departure times on kulula.com, ba.com or Comair.co.za. "Our staff are working hard to ensure minimum disruption to our customers. "We are actively working with SAAT and SACAA to find a speedy solution. "We thank all our customers for their understanding and patience." Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
