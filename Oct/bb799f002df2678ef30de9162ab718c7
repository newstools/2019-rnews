 Arbedeen - Two male suspects aged 35-52 were arrested for possession of suspected stolen sheep on Sunday. "The arrest followed after members were patrolling on the N9 route from Graaf-Reinett to Aberdeen and they saw a vehicle parked along the road," said police spokesperson, Capt Khaya Tonejni. "The owner of vehicle said that he was stuck without petrol when asked by police. "Members became suspicious when they heard kicking noise from inside the vehicle boot." Capt Tonjeni said that upon further investigation, four sheep were found in the boot and the two suspects were arrested. "The vehicle was also confiscated." Both suspects were expected to appear at the Graaf Reinett Magistrate's Court on Monday facing a charge of possession of suspected stolen stock/property. "The owner of the sheep from Aberdeen will come this afternoon to identify his stock," said Capt Tonjeni. Eastern Cape SAPS Provincial Commissioner, Lt Gen Liziwe Ntshinga, commended the members for the arrest and their vigilance. "One or two suspects in court and stock recovery is a step closer to winning the fifht against rampant stock theft," said Lt Gen Ntshinga.
