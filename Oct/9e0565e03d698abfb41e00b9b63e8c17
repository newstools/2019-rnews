 Port Alfred - Two suspects are expected in court after they were arrested by Port Alfred police within eight hours for possession of allegedly stolen vehicles. "In the early hours of Tuesday morning, members of the Port Alfred Operational Command Centre were holding a vehicle check point when they stopped an Light motor vehicle," said police spokesperson, Captain Mali Govender. "On checking the details of the vehicle, it was discovered that it had been stolen in Uitenhage. "A suspect, aged 42, was arrested for possession of suspected stolen motor vehicle." She said that later in the afternoon, members of the Port Alfred K9 unit received information of a possibly stolen motor vehicle that was travelling from the direction of East London towards Port Alfred. "Members responded and as they proceeded towards Fish river, the vehicle, a silver Chevrolet, which matched the description given, passed them," Capt Govender said. "They made a u-turn and managed to pull the vehicle off the road. "During the preliminary investigation, it was established that the vehicle was stolen in Port Elizabeth." A 23-year-old male was also arrested for possession of suspected stolen motor vehicle. "Both suspects will appear in the local magistrate’s court later this week." Port Alfred SAPS Cluster Commander, Brigadier Morgan Govender, commended both the teams for their swift response and arrests as well as the local security company, who provided information.
