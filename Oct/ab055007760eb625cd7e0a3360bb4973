 Port Elizabeth - The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Wednesday advised local residents and businesses that the telephone system at the Korsten Traffic and Driving Licensing Centre is unavailable. "The telephone system at our Korsten Traffic and Driving License Centre (TDLC) is currently unavailable due to a technical error," the Metro said. "Even though a ringtone can be heard by consumers, when calls are made to the centre, the devices do not function as normal on our end. "The issue was reported to Telkom but unfortunately we do not have a current timeline when the matter will be resolved." The Metro said that all services are proceeding as normal except for the telephonic booking system at Korsten TDLC. "In the interim, bookings for driver's license renewals can still be made at 041 995 2737." Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
