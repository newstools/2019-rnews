 Port Elizabeth - Effective 11 March 2019, there is a new provision in the court rules that enables debtors to rescind their High Court judgements without having to show good cause. A person against whom a judgement had been granted in the High Court would need to apply to court and prove good cause for having such judgement rescinded. This required a debtor to prove: The mere subsequent settlement of a judgement debt would not constitute a cause for setting aside a lawfully issued judgement. In terms of the Courts of Law Amendment Act No. 7 of 2017, section 23A was inserted into the rules to specifically provide for rescission of judgement with either written consent of the judgement creditor, alternatively where the judgement debt has been paid in full by the judgement debtor, irrespective of whether or not the judgement creditor has consented to the rescission of judgement. In the latter instance, the application for rescission: The court may make any cost order it deems fit with regard to such an application. The aforesaid introduction of this new manner of rescinding judgements certainly is beneficial for debtors wishing to clear their records and does, in the writer’s view, fill a previous void in the rules pertaining to court judgements.
