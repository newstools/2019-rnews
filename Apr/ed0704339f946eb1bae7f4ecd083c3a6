  Port Elizabeth - The monetary jurisdiction of Small Claims Courts in South Africa has been increased from R15,000 to R20,000 from 1 April 2019. The Small Claims Court allows you to institute minor civil claims in a speedy, affordable and simple manner without using an attorney. Even if your claim qualifies for the Small Claims Court, think of asking your lawyer for guidance on whether it is your best course of action. Sometimes even seemingly minor claims can have wide ramifications, and there is no substitute for professional advice! Contact the legal team at Goldberg & de Villiers Inc on 041 5019800.
