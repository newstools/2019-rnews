 Port Elizabeth - The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Monday advised residents and businesses that water will be shut down in parts of the City for maintenance on Tuesday, the 30th of April 2019. "The maintenance carried out will help the Nelson Mandela Bay Municiplity Water Loss Programme to assist in reducing the water losses within the jurisdiction of the Municipal boundary," explained Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Communications and Media Management Officer, Mthubanzi Mniki.

"In doing this, we will be able to accurately measure the amount of water being fed, thus, helping us create more savings," Mniki added. "If this exercise goes according to schedule, then the entire area will have no water for a maximum of approximately 5 hours. "We would like to carry this exercise out at a time during the day when as few consumers as possible are inconvenianced and it has been suggested that we do the upgrades between the hours of 09h00 and 14h00. "We therefore ask for your co-operation in this matter. We apologize for any inconvenience caused."
