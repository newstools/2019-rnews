 Port Elizabeth - A Port Elizabeth woman, who was reported missing from a local retirement home in Sydenham, Port Elizabeth, last week, was found by police severely assaulted. According to police information, 53-year-old  Ronell Topper, who has one leg, disappeared at the beginning of April. Topper left the Sydenham Retirement Village in Wayne Street, Port Elizabeth, with Gerhard Germishuizen (59) and the couple promised to return six days later. "Germishuizen also resides at the retirement village," described police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. After not returning, her son opened a missing person report at the Mount Road police station. However, on Monday afternoon police found her at a lodge in Newton Park, Port Elizabeth, severely assaulted. Apparently, the owner of the lodge contacted police after finding her lying on a bed with serious injuries. Police say that Topper and a friend (possibly Germishuizen) booked into the lodge on the 4th of April - the same day they left the Sydenham Retirement Village. On Monday, the lodge owner went to inform them to vacate the premises - which is when Topper was found lying on the bed with serious injuries. Her companion was arrested for assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
