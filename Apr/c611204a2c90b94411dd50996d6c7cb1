 Port Elizabeth - The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Tuesday afternoon informed Port Elizabeth residents that it is currently experiencing difficulties in supplying certain storage reservoirs due to the Schoenmakerskop Pumpstation not having full electricity supply. "The reservoir levels are low and at risk of emptying as consumption is higher than supply," said Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Communications and Media Management Officer, Mthubanzi Mniki. "Electricity and Energy will augment supply during off peak hours to allow more pumps to run at a time, however, it is recommended that consumers reduce consumption during this period to avoid disruptions in supply." "The situation will be monitored and water tankers will be made available if reservoir storage levels deplete, their positions will be communicated throughout social media and can also be enquired from 0800205050," Mniki said. "We apologize for any inconvenience caused." Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook. For news on the Western Cape click here.
