 Kinkelbos - Police at Kinkelbos, just outside Port Elizabeth, arrested a 39-year-old female suspect for alleged dagga possession while conducting safer festive season patrols on the N2 highway. "This followed after the SAPS members pulled off a white Hyundai Elantra at about 04:00 on Friday morning just before the Sundays River bridge," said police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge. "It was soon established that a couple gave a hiker (the suspect) a lift from East London to Port Elizabeth. "After searching the vehicle, a bag containing 15 kilograms of dagga (estimated street value of R20 000) was discovered in the boot of the vehicle and confiscated." Capt Beetge said that the suspect was arrested for dealing in dagga and will be appearing in the Alexandria Magistrate's Court on Monday. She faces a charge of dealing in dagga.
