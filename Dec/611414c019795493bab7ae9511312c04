 Mthatha - The Eastern Cape Provincial Government on Monday joined millions of South Africans and other countries in congratulating Eastern Cape-born Zozibini Tunzi for winning the Miss Universe 2019 crown. Tunzi had previously been crowned Miss South Africa 2019. She is the third woman from South Africa to win the title, and the first black woman since Leila Lopes was crowned Miss Universe 2011.  "Zozibini Tunzi’s success at the Miss Universe 2019 competition is a victory that should inspire young girls from all rural villages that they too can be the best in what they do when they focus on it and work to achieve their goals," said Eastern Cape Premier, Oscar Mabuyane. "This victory proves that when South Africans work together, support each other, we make it possible for our young people to stand tall in such important competitions. "Now that all of us supported Zozibini Tunzi to win the Miss Universe 2019 crown, we have a serious duty to support her during her reign so that the work she will do becomes a success. "The projects she will be working on during her reign are an important part of our efforts to build a better province, a better country and a better world." He once again congratulated Zozibini Tunzi for winning the Miss Universe 2019 crown, the Miss South Africa company and its sponsors for supporting her as she was preparing for this competition. Mabuyane also noted both her parents for always being there for their daughter at all times "and the creatively funny South Africans, who are always behind Zozi".
