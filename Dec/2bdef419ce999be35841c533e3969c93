 Centane - Eastern Cape Police provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga, said she learnt with shock the brutal killings of three women aged 17, 39 and 52 in Centane. "It is alleged that a 49-year-old man, who was armed with a bush knife, confronted his own family on Sunday, at about 09h00, at Khabakazi Locality, Gqunqe Village, Centane," described police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha. "The family members managed to run away from him. "When he came back, it is alleged that he attacked his neighbours with his bush knife." Sadly three women aged 17, 39 and 52,  all passed away. "Three people, who tried to intervene were attacked and seriously injured and they were all rushed to Tafalofefe hospital, Centane." Capt Manatha said that the suspect later fled to a nearby forest. "Centane Police with the assistance of the community looked for the suspect in the forest. He was found around 16h45 hiding in the forest and has been arrested." He added that the suspect has been charged with three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder. "The motive behind the murder is not known. The suspect is expected to appear Centane Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, on charges of three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder." The identities of the deceased are still being withheld as some of their close relatives are not yet informed of their murders.
