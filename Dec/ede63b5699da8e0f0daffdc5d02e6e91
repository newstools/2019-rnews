 Port Elizabeth - The Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) Stadium on Tuesday announced its planned road show to officially launch its 2019 Summer campaign. “The festive season is officially upon us and we are excited to take to the streets of Nelson Mandela Bay Metro to inform residents of the Stadium’s jam-packed holiday season line up they can anticipate this December,” said Phumulani Hlatshwayo, NMB Stadium’s Head of Commercial. The stadium’s planned roadshow will run from Thursday 5 December, ending on Wednesday 11 December. 2019 marked the Stadium’s 10-year anniversary and the roadshow will be a culmination of the facility’s 10-year celebrations that took place throughout the year. “This has been a momentous year in the history of the stadium, having reached 10 years of existence. We want to conclude it with a bang to mark all the great achievements amassed over the past decade,” added Hlatshwayo. “Our state-of-the-art multi-purpose facility has played an integral part in social cohesion in the city of Port Elizabeth in particular, and the Eastern Cape Province in general through its hosting of sporting and entertainment events that cut across all racial groups and class ranks,” said Hlatshwayo. Residents will be entertained through local sounds, participate in fun interactive games and will stand a chance to win promotional item giveaways such as branded t-shirts, beanies, caps, key rings, soccer and rugby balls. There will be a ticket give-away to the Chippa United FC versus Supersport United FC soccer match taking place on Saturday, 21 December, kicking off at 20h15 at NMB Stadium.
