 Port Elizabeth - The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Wednesday advised residents that it is reducing the operational days of public swimming pools due to drought. "Due to the prevailing drought with our main supply dam levels below 35% a decision was made to reduce the operational days of municipal swimming pools," the Metro said. "This means that the Kings Beach middle pool, Zwide, Motherwell, Wells Estate, Gelvandale, Varsvlei, Rosedale and KwaNobuhle swimming pools will be closed from Monday to Thursday every week until the end of December. "However, these facilities will be open for business on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays."
