 Port Elizabeth-based private security company, Atlas Security, on Tuesday said that it learnt with great sadness the passing of two of their female members on Monday afternoon in a car accident. It was reported that three Atlas Security members had been involved in a motor vehicle accident on Monday afternoon. "Two members, Micayla Victor and Celine De Ridder passed away at the scene, while the third member, Juanita De Villiers was admitted to hospital," the company said.
