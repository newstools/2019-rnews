 If you are a South African resident and have offshore investments you should understand how the income earned from these investments is taxed. As a South African tax resident (which most people who live in South Africa permanently are), you are obliged to pay tax on your worldwide income. Please note that it is always best to check the Double Taxation Agreement that exists between South Africa and the country from which you receive your offshore investment income. This agreement may have specific taxing rights for the offshore investment income that you receive that differs from what is set out above. Also note that the above sets out the general position; there are many variables that may change how your offshore investment income is taxed.
