 The scourge of trading sexual favours for jobs has now allegedly reared its head in Queenstown, in the Enoch Mgijima Local Municipality, and must be investigated as a matter of urgency, the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape said on Tuesday. DA Eastern Cape leader, Nqaba Bhanga, was joined by Geordin Hill-Lewis and Georgina Faldtman, at a picket in the town against the alleged sex for jobs in Queenstown. "We were joined by community members and local councillors during a picket outside the Chris Hani Regional Offices of the Eastern Cape Department of Roads and Public Works," Bhanga added. "This follows allegations of sex being requested of desperate women to ensure jobs within the department’s Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP). "We also met with the department’s regional director to bring the allegations to his attention." He said that he will now escalate this issue to his colleagues in the Eastern Cape Legislature to request an urgent investigation by the Department of Roads and Public Works into the allegations in Queenstown. "Government must, as a matter of urgency, criminalise Sex for Jobs interviews (also known as carpet interviews). "The only way we will combat the scourge of carpet interviews is if we deal swiftly and decisively with each and every perpetrator," Bhanga said. "We must show zero tolerance for this kind of abuse, and we must show no leniency at all for those found guilty. Perpetrators must be convicted by the law."
