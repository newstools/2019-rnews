 The idea to charge at a policeman with a knife did not end well for an alleged criminal at a cell tower in Petersen Street, Kwadwesi Extension, Port Elizabeth, on Wednesday night. According to police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, the police officers had responded to a burglary at the cell tower when one of the officers was attacked by a knife-wielding suspect. In defense, the police officers shot the suspect in the upper leg while another suspect, armed with a screwdriver, was also apprehended. "Both suspects are 25 years old and broke into the premises to steal electrical wires. "They were caught red-handed when the attack took place," Captain Beetge said. Captain Beetge said that the injured suspect was taken to Dora Nginza Hospital where he is recovering under police guard. "The two will appear before the New Brighton Magistrate's Court on Friday to face charges of housebreaking business and theft as well as attempted murder. "Additional charges of damaging infrastructure could still be added." "Attacks on police members will not be tolerated. We will defend ourselves and also plea with the courts to hand down harsh sentences to suspects that threaten and attack SAPS members," said the Motherwell SAPS Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie. The attack happened just a few days before the National Police Day on 27 January. "Police safety is the responsibility of every citizen and we are calling on our communities to protect their emergency services life lines. SAPS serves its communities with selfless priority. Our communities should do the same," added General Rabie. Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
