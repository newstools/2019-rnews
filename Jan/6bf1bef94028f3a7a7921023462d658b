 The recently formed iBhayi Small Business Chamber hosted their first official event on Thursday at the Protea Hotel in Summerstrand, Port Elizabeth. The iBhayi Small Business Chamber was created in November 2018 for the benefit of small businesses in the Nelson Mandela Bay area. The chamber aims to help improve local businesses and provide a collective group of people with their own experiences who can help each other grow and succeed. To assist with this growth the Chamber hosted their first official event since their inception; a Speed Marketing event. The aim of the Speed Marketing event was to get the members of the chamber to introduce their businesses to each other and see if they could form partnerships and help their fellow local small businesses. More than 20 small business owners attended the Speed Marketing event. Each business owner had two minutes to talk about their business in an elevator pitch format, keeping strictly to what their business is about and what kind of service they provide.
