 Eastern Cape Premier, Phumulo Masualle, on Wednesday visited Upper Gqogqora, a area that falls part of the Intsika Yethu Local Municipality, in the Chris Hani District, where he met local School Principals, School Governing Bodies and parents of learners in the surrounding communities. The Premier said it was rather overwhelming to see a school that consistently produced good results despite facing infrastructure-related challenges among others. The high school in the area has been consistent with their matric pass rate that ranges between 70 - 96% for the past 10 years. "This school undermines the theory that  good infrastructure necessarily leads to good results. There isn't an infrastructure here but we've got good results while there are school that have good infrastructure but produce poor results," Premier Masualle said. "Yes we have to ensure that the norms and standards are kept and sustained however it is not a conducive environment." Premier Masualle noticed that the there are learners and parents have school preferences which results in other learners suffering due to long distances they travel to get to school. He noted that a scholar transport is necessary, however, it is not the duty of the government to provide transport when it is the learners and parents choice to travel from far to get to their preferential school. He said that the job of the government is to ensure that good education is provided at every school. "You don't subsidies or pay for choice where people leave the existing schools to schools of their choice, government is not liable to that. Let's be firm on the application of the policy in this regard," Masualle described. He also acknowledged the passionate teachers and principals "who continue to do stirling work."
