 Port Elizabeth police on Thursday morning warned motorists to avoid the R335 near Motherwell after residents of a nearby informal settlement took to blocking the road and damaging passing cars in a protest over the lack of water and electricity in their area. Taxis that pass by the R335 Addo Road next to Ikamvelihle were forced to use alternative routes to get to their destinations on Thursday morning. Apparently the protests started at arount 20:00 and 22:30 on Wednesday night where about 200 residents of Nomakanje, in Ikamvelihle, blocked the road and burned tyres and rubble. Speaking for SAPS in Motherwell, Captain Andre Beetge, said that Public Order Police had to disperse the protestors after a truck was burnt inside the Municipal Depot on the R335. By 22:30, the area had calmed down. On Thursday morning, petrol bombs were thrown at two other trucks. “Only one had partial burn damage when the petrol bomb caught fire inside the truck," Captain Beetge described. “More road blockages are sporadically created along the R335 road by these protestors. "SAPS are deployed along the route to restore the situation." Captain Beetge urged motorists to use alternative routes until the situation calms down.
