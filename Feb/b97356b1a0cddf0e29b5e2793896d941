 Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Mongameli Bobani, will on Thursday face his second motion of no confidence since taking over as Mayor in August last year when a coalition of parties backed by the African National Congress (ANC) managed to oust the then Democratic Alliance (DA) led coalition administration. This time, the Patriotic Alliance (PA), whose sole Councillor in the Bay, Marlon Daniels, has had an on-and-off relationship with Bobani, want him out and a new Mayor elected. In its submission for Council to debate its motion of no confidence against Bobani, the Patriotic Alliance says Bobani's removal as Mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay is in the best interest of local residents. Just a few months ago, the PA had responded to those criticising Bobani’s new administration saying he deserved a chance to show that black people can govern. 1. The Patriotic Alliance says that Mayor Bobani "cannot be trusted" as the Mayor, which is why he has to go. 2. The party says that Mayor Bobani "has done little to none to better the lives of poor communities". 3. The Patriotic Alliance blames Bobani for the murders that have been happening in the Nelson Mandela Bay townships. 4. The party further alleges that Bobani is misusing taxpayers monies instead of ensuring service delivery. 5. It also alleges that he he takes instructions from a single unnamed person in his ANC-dominated Mayoral Committee while there are many Mayoral Committee members.   What the PA - and the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), who supported the motion, need is numbers for the Bobani's ousting to succeed. On paper, they do not have those numbers, but as seen in the ousting of the DA-led coalition, one can never say never in politics.
