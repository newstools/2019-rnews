 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape on Thursday announce that its councillor, Renaldo Gouws, is its candidate for the upcoming Nelson Mandela Bay Ward 2 by-election to replace former Councillor, Dean Biddulph. Biddulph resigned in December 2018, leaving the ward without a Councillor. "This by-election is to be held on 6 March 2019," said DA Eastern Cape leader, Nqaba Bhanga. "Cllr Gouws, who has a Master’s Degree in Industrial and Organisational Psychology, has in the past proven himself and has a great knowledge of all the issues affecting the residents of ward 2." Gouws is also a well-known South African YouTuber, who tackles issues of politics and society. Bhanga said that Gouws served a four year term as chairperson of the Ward 2 committee and also did his part as the acting ward councillor whilst his predecessor, Dean Biddulph, was serving as a member of the mayoral committee. The councillor that will win the by-election will deal with the concerns of residents in the areas of South End, Humerail, Humewood, Forest Hill, Brookes Hill and parts of Summerstrand. "He will devote his full attention to the ward.," he described. "By fielding this candidate the DA is putting its best foot forward and the party is confident of reclaiming Ward 2. This will put the DA in a good position to yet again take over as the government in Nelson Mandela Bay."
