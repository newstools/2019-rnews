 Port Elizabeth - Port Elizabeth police have appealed for leads after a 44-year-old man was shot and killed while he was driving his vehicle in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, on Monady night. He has been identified as Thembalethu Godfrey Norushe. "At about 21:45 members on duty at Motherwell police station saw a gold Toyota Corrola drive into the station parking lot where it bumped into a concrete pole," described police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge. "The members took a closer look and found that the driver and vehicle was shot. "The wounded driver could barely speak and an ambulance was summoned, but on arrival he passed away from his wounds on the scene." Capt Beetge said that it has since emerged that he was going to attend to a taxi related meeting in NU10, and police suspect that on his way there, he was shot at by unknown gunmen. "After being attacked and shot he managed to drive to the police station to seek emergency assistance. He still had all his valuables in his vehicle," Capt Beetge said. "The motive for the attack is still unknown as it could possibly be a failed robbery or hijacking, but the possibility of a targeted murder cannot be ruled out. "All possibilities will be investigated." Eastern Cape SAPS Provincial Organised Crime Investigation team have taken the case and any person with information that could assist police with this investigation can contact Lt Colonel Willie Mayi at 082 697 5914 or 08600 10111.
