 Port Elizabeth - Despite good rains last week and the Churchill Dam overflowing, Nelson Mandela Bay is still firmly in the grips of a drought, the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality said on Monday. "This puts the onus on the municipality to continue its water conservation efforts and residents to use water sparingly," described Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Spokesman, Kupido Baron. Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor Mongameli Bobani said since the rain the fell last week, apart from Churchill Dam, there has been no significant increase in the average dam levels. “The biggest impact has been at Churchill Dam that increased from 86% to 100%. The latter level was reached over the weekend and currently the dam is only overflowing by 50 to 80 mm," the Mayor said. "For how long this will continue is uncertain, but the impact of the rain and whatever spillage over Churchill that did occur, raised the Impofu Dam by about 0.3%. “Both these dams are on the Kromme River with Impofu thrice the size of Churchill,” said Mayor Bobani.
