 Ugie - Eastern Cape police have condemned that attack on an elderly couple, aged 68 and 67, on Wednesday last week on their Albany/Bluegum Vale Farm at Gubenxe Valley area, near Ugie. The elderly couple were attacked by three unknown suspects. "According to the reports, three suspects approached one of the victims after he went out of the yard to relieve himself," said police spokesperson, Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana. "One of the suspects, who was armed, forced the elderly man back into the house where they demanded bank cards from him and his wife. "The report suggests that the suspects then drove to town with them and drew an undisclosed amount of money from the victims’s bank cards before returning back to the farm. "As they arrived back at the farm, the suspects tied the elderly man, but not his wife and locked them in the bedroom. "They allegedly threw petrol in the house and set it alight." Brig Kinana said that due to the fact that the woman was not tied up, she managed to untie her husband and they both managed to get out of the house through the windows and alerted the SAPS. "The suspects escaped the scene with a vehicle unknown and no arrests have been made at this stage," he added. "The couple was taken to hospital for medical care. A case of House Robbery is under investigation. "Anyone who can assist with an information that will lead to the arrest of the suspects must please contact the investigating officer W/O Methuse at 045-9331193 or call the Crime Stop number 086 00 10111."
