 Port Elizabeth - While security officers were busy servicing an ATM at the Cleary Park shopping centre in Gelvandale, one of them accidently shot himself in his upper leg. "It is alleged that at about 14:30, shoppers suddenly started frantically running into the centre and were screaming," described police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "The security officers thought that they were being attacked and went down in combat position. "As the guard assumed the position, he accidently shot himself in his right upper leg. "He was taken to hospital for treatment. "A case of discharging a firearm in a municipal area was opened." Col Naidu said that investigations later revealed that there was an alleged shooting between rival gangs at the taxi rank near the centre thereby causing the commuters and shoppers to rush into the centre in order to escape injury. "At the same time, the PE K9 unit members were patrolling around the shopping centre when they were stopped by a taxi. They were informed that one of the shooters boarded a taxi, which was behind them," she described. "With the assistance of SAPS Kabega Park Crime Prevention members, the taxi was pulled over in Norman Middleton Street. "The K9 members apprehended the 20-year-old suspect inside the taxi." A .38 revolver was found tucked in his pants. "He is detained on a charge of attempted murder and illegal possession of a firearm. He is expected to appear in court on Monday." The firearm will be sent to ballistics for analysis. Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook. For news on the Western Cape click here.
