 Port Elizabeth - The Makana Local Municipality on Monday announced it will be implementing a trial of phased zonal water rationing from Tuesday. This is in an ongoing effort to find a workable solution to manage the limited town water supply Makana Municipality. "Residents will be aware that the Municipality has previously attempted to manage water usage with scheduled water shedding which involved limiting supply to the entire town at specified hours," the Municipality said. "This method has proved difficult to manage and detrimental to the balance and stability of the water system which is vulnerable to repeated pressure fluctuations and resulted in increased water losses. "It is hoped that zonal rationing, which will see smaller areas being isolated from the supply, will be more manageable and enable the water management team to protect and manage the more vulnerable areas of the reticulation network while ensuring consistent supply to the whole community." The municipality added that zonal rationing will work as follows. The town of Makhanda - formerly Grahamstown, has been divided into 7 zones which will be rationed in turn for 24hours at a time from 07h00 each morning. "This is an unprecedented approach and will take some time to perfect but also may have unexpected outcome," the municipality said.
