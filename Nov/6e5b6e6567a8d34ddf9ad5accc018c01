 Port Elizabeth - The SAPS Algoa Park, Women’s Network and the CPF held a Christmas party on Friday for children of police officers, who sacrificed their lives while serving their communities. "Every person and every child respond to death in unique ways as every situation is unique," explained police spokeserson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "Children, who face grief of a parent undergo many challenges as they try to cope with their loss and make an effort to move forward in their lives." She said that the SAPS is an organisation where "we are ONE family and the death of a fallen hero not only affects his/her family but also leaves an indelible mark on the SAPS family as well". "The children were reminded that these fallen heroes will never be forgotten and that the children must be proud of their fathers/mothers. Gifts and some goodies were given to each child," she added. "Such a gesture from the organisers was overwhelming and welcoming. Let us continue to inspire these children and lift the legacy of their hero parent so that they will be able to cope with their loss with loving memories."
