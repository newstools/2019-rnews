 Port Elizabeth - A habitual criminal, who invoked fear in the community of Bethelsdorp, Port Elizabeth, since 2013 has finally being sent to prison for a very long time. "On Friday, Nathaniel Trevor Stokes (25) was sentenced in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court to an effective 21 years imprisonment on 14 charges including housebreaking and theft, theft out of/from motor vehicles and illegal possession of firearm and ammunition," said police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "The crimes were committed within the Bethelsdorp area from 2013 to 2017." Col Naidu added that in March 2018, Stokes, who was wanted by police was finally arrested in Greenfields in Bethelsdorp. "He remained in custody until his sentencing." Mount Road SAPS Cluster Commander, Maj Gen Thembisile Patekile, commended the investigating officer, D/Sgt Attie Knoetze in linking the accused to so many cases. "It is clear that the accused committed these crimes out of greed and exploited the community. He will now spend a long time behind bars," added Maj Gen Patekile.
