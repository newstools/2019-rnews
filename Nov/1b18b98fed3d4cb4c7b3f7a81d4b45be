 Port Alfred - Despite the heightened awareness on Gender Based Violence, perpetrators continue to prey on innocent unsuspecting victims. "At approximately 13h40, on Monday, a victim in her late teens was jogging along West Beach in Port Alfred when she was approached by a male, who was armed with a knife," described police spokesperson, Captain Mali Govender. "The male sexually assaulted her at knifepoint and thereafter robbed her of her cellphone and fled. "SAPS K9 members and local security officers, who were in the vicinity managed to arrest the fleeing 19-year-old suspect." Capt Govender saidd that the stolen cellphone was also recovered by members of the K9 unit. "The severely traumatised victim was treated and is receiving trauma counselling." Port Alfred SAPS Cluster Commander Brigadier, Morgan Govender, expressed his outrage at the monstrous attack and vowed that the SAPS will lend support to the victim through this traumatic incident and throughout court proceedings. He further commended the members and the local security officers for their speedy response in the arrest of the suspect, who will appear in the Port Alfred Magistrate's Court later this week.
