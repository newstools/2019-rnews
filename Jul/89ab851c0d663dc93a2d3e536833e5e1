 Port Elizabeth - The Nelson Mandela Bay Business Chamber on Wednesday said that the go slow at Transnet's Port of Ngqura, adjacent the Coega SEZ, is concerning. "We are deeply concerned about the go-slow which is taking place at the Port of Ngqura," said Nelson Mandela Bay Business Chamber President, Dr Andrew Muir. "This is causing serious damage to our local economy through the inability of the port to handle imports and exports." Dr Muir added that the automotive and agriculture industries in particular have been severely disrupted. "This lost business and cost may never be recovered and equally concerning, this is impacting upon downstream  businesses as well as South Africa’s image as a reliable supplier to global export markets," he said. "We call upon the relevant stakeholders to act in the best interests of the economy by urgently resolving the current situation and returning back to normal operations."
