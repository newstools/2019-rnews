 East London - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader in the Eastern Cape, Nqaba Bhanga, on Friday said that he will be laying criminal charges against those implicated in the Public Protector’s report regarding the Siyenza toilet scandal at the Fleet Street Police Station in East London. "The DA welcomes the Public Protector’s report into the R631-million scandal in the Amathole District Municipality (ADM), which has found that there was improper conduct and maladministration in the awarding of the tender to Siyenza," Bhanga said. "The report has found that former ADM municipal manager, Chris Magwanqana, failed to fulfil his fiduciary duties as the Accounting Officer of the municipality, and that irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure in excess of R103-million was incurred. "The report further found that the contract between Blue Nightingale Trading 397 (Pty Ltd) trading as Siyenza and the Amathole District Municipality was unconstitutional, and the awarding of the tender to Siyenza was also in violation of the Local Government Municipal Finance Management Act." Bhanga said that he will therefore be laying charges of corruption against Mr Magwanqana, the Amathole District Municipality and Siyenza. "The DA believes that those who are guilty of corruption must be sentenced to a minimum of 15 years. It is high time that those responsible for stealing money meant for the people of this province are put behind bars."
