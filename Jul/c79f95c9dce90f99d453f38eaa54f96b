 Port Elizabeth - Motherwell SAPS Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, condemned what he called the "callous murder" of a teenage girl in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth. According to police information, officers on Tuesday afternoon responded to a murder in Kwamanube Street in NU6, Motherwell. "At 16:00, the body of a 14-year-old school pupil still dressed in school uniform was found lying in the street with a single bullet wound to her head," described police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge. "Thus far, nobody has come forward that might have seen what happened and police are baffled what possible reason there would be for this girl's killing." Capt Beetge said that there is a strong suspicion that the murder is a targeted killing as no valuables were taken by her attackers. "The name of the girl is witheld at this stage for security reasons as well as out of fear of victimisation towards the family." He said that investigators of the Motherwell Cluster Serious Violent Crime Unit have been roped in to conduct the investigation. "Any person with information that could assist police with the investigation can contact Detective Warrant Officer Rynhard Marks at 082 442 0962," Capt Beetge said. The Provincial Commissioner of the Eastern Cape, Lt General Liziwe Ntshinga expressed her condolences to the close family and friends of the victim and added that "We (the SAPS) will not leave any stone unturned in bringing this killer(s) to book."
