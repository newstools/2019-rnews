 Makhanda - The National Arts Festival closed on Sunday 7 July after an eleven day cultural binge of arts and entertainment. A sold out performance by Freshlyground and a free parade through the streets of Makhanda helped see out the Festival.   Organisers say it's too early to report on how the Festival performed but the overall impression is that the 2019 National Arts Festival was resilient in tough economic times and very well received by audiences.  On Saturday night, the Standard Bank Ovation Awards celebrated artistic innovation, excellence, the exploration of new performance styles and the courage to open new conversations at the National Arts Festival.   This year the Ovations panel (who anonymously visit productions on the Fringe) comprised 28 members including artists, theatre practitioners, academics and other experts in the cultural field. Theatre-maker Mandisi Sindo was the convenor of this year’s panel, and he was joined by co-convenors Tara Notcutt and Nondumiso Msimang  The Standard Bank Ovation Award ceremony honoured all the winners of Ovations recognised throughout the Festival’s run, and also named the winners of the prestigious Gold, Silver and Bronze Awards. Special awards were also given across numerous categories.  Winning an Ovation Award is considered an important mark of quality work and the accolade forms a pathway from the Fringe to the Arena programme for which Ovation winners are invited to submit works.   Says convenor Mandisi Sindo, “The National Arts Festival Fringe programme is and has always been the heart of the National Arts Festival. "It gives platform and a space to all art practitioners from all art forms. The Fringe programme was made up of hundreds of productions including theatre, family fare, comedy, illusion, dance, contemporary music, music recital , poetry, visual art, film and physical theatre. Some from the development phase of creation and others already in the professional spectrum. This year's Fringe festival productions spoke strongly of the political and environmental issues that affect us all."   This year’s outstanding Standard Bank Ovation Award winners were:    Gold Standard Bank Ovation Award winners XOVA – South African State Theatre    Silver Standard Bank Ovation Award winners FRUIT – Sketch Productions (Theatre) WARONA – Ukwanda Puppets & Design Art Collective (Theatre) UNFATHOMABLE by Alex Halligey and Athena Mazarakis (Theatre) LOST & FOUND - Matchbox Theatre Collective and Theatre on Pointe (Dance)   Bronze Standard Bank Ovation Winners CURRENTLY (G)OLD - Kwasha Theatre Company (Theatre)  (W)ASEM - Terence Makapan  (Theatre)  A PLACE OF KNOWING - Intsusa in collaboration with TheatreDuo (Theatre) UMNOTHO THE ECONOMY - Young Outreach Artists (Theatre) YOU SHOULD BE DANCING - FollowSpot Productions (Comedy)     Standard Bank Ovation Cut Above Winners  QUAVA by Quava Vocal Choir (Music Recital and Review)  UMTHOMBO - Amandla Danca Teatro ZA (Dance, Physical or Visual Theatre)  BENNY BUSHWACKER – Mamba Productions (Comedy) FAINT PATCH OF LIGHT - Sizile Arts Collective (Theatre)    Standard Bank Ovation Ensemble Award Winners Awarded to an ensemble cast  The cast of CURRENTLY (G)OLD by Kwasha Theatre Company (Theatre) The cast of PLACE OF KNOWING by Intsusa & Theatre Duo (Theatre) The cast of UMNOTHO THE ECONOMY by the Young Outreach Artists (Theatre) The cast of WARONA by the Ukwanda Puppets & Design Art Collective (Theatre)  The cast of JEREMIAH FYAH ISES AND THE BAAKAHYAAD BAND by Jeremiah Fyah Ises (Contemporary Music)   Standard Bank Ovation Solo Award Winners Awarded to a single performer FRUIT – Matshidiso Mokoteli (Theatre) HOW TO BE A POLITICIAN IN SOUTH AFRICA 2019 – Nkosinathi Maki (Comedy) WHEN COASTS MEET– Khwezi Becker (Theatre) (W)ASEM - Terence Makapan (Theatre) BENNY BUSHWHACKER – Ben Voss  (Comedy)   Standard Bank Ovation Spirit of the Fringe Award Awarded to performers or productions whose work represented the spirit and variety of the Fringe THE BLIND DATEby the South African Library for the Blind  JR NKOSI DUO by JR Nkosi FollowSpot Productions Rob van Vuuren  Stuart Lightbody    Standard Bank Ovation Award Winners 2019  The full list of the productions that received Standard Bank Ovation Awards at the 2019 National Arts Festival are:   Saturday 6 July   A FAINT PATCH OF LIGHT – Sizile Arts Collective MAKHANDA KWANTU CHOIR: VOICE DANCE! – Kwantu Group   Friday 5 July   047 – Muthaland Entertainment iGRUFFALO – National Arts Festival / Tall Stories UK YOUR PERFECT LIFE – F Creations BENNY BUSHWHACKER – Mamba Productions UMNOTHO THE ECONOMY – Young Outreach Artists (W)asem – Terence Makapan WALLS & PILLOWS – Peo Entle Production WARONA – Ukwanda Puppets & Design Art Collective   Thursday 4 July   XOVA – South African State Theatre THE CHOCOLATE CHRONICLES – Siv Ngesi Productions   Wednesday 3 July   FRUIT – Sketch Productions CLIQUE CLAQ   Tuesday 2 July   WHEN COASTS MEET A STAR IS BORN – THE RISE AND FALL OF JUDY GARLAND – Wela Kapela Productions JEREMIAH FYAH ISES AND THE BAAKAHYAAD BAND – Jeremiah Fyah Ises CURRENTLY (G)OLD – Kwasha Theatre Company   Monday 1 July   NGUVU YA MBEGU – Abengcongolo Collective UMTHOMBO – Amandla Danca Teatro ZA FRIZZ POP – Frizz Pop Comedy SAXMAN ANDREW YOUNG & BAND HOW TO BE A POLITICIAN IN SOUTH AFRICA – 2019 – Maki Holdings (Pty) Ltd THE SYRINGA TREE   Sunday 30 June   UNFATHOMABLE  YOU SHOULD BE DANCING – FollowSpot Productions   Saturday 29 June   TATS IS CANCELLED – Siv Ngesi Productions LOST & FOUND – Matchbox Theatre Collective and Theatre on Pointe LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD & THE BIG BAD METAPHORS – University of Pretoria MOTHER EARTH – Nan Hua Temple   Friday 28 June   A PLACE OF KNOWING – Intsusa in collaboration with TheatreDuo QUAVA VOCAL GROUP   2019 Student Awards  The winners of the 2019 Student Awards were also announced at the Standard Bank Ovation Awards ceremony.
