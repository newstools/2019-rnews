 Cradock - The Chris Hani District Municipality on Tuesday assured the community of Cradock, in the Inxuba Yethemba Local Municipality, that the repairs at the Waste Water Treatment Plant in the area are in full swing. "The district have also dispatched a scientist to look at the rehabilitation process of the river from the plant that has been contaminated over the period," described Lonwabo Kowa, Communication Officer at the Chris Hani District Municipality. Responding to claims by the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape that work had apparently stopped, Kowa said progress is being made. "Currently, work is continuing uninterrupted and we are not aware of any work stoppages. The Municipality is giving all the needed support to the contractor to make sure that the work is completed in due course," he added. "Once again, we wish to express our sincere apology to all communities that have been affected in this regard. "Additionally we would also like to put it on record that water that is consumed by Cradock communities is not contaminated as it is properly purified to ensure that it is safe for human consumption. "We will be in constant contact with stakeholders from Cradock until the repair work is completed."
