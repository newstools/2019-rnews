 East London - The African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape has congratulates Eastern Cape Premier, Lubabalo Oscar Mabuyane, on receiving a Rhino Conservation Award. The Premier recieved the award on Sunday at the Monte Casino in Gauteng. "He was the second runner-up on the category that he was nominated on," said Gift Ngqondi, ANC Eastern Cape Provincial Head of Communications. "What makes us happy as the Province is the fact that Premier Mabuyane was the only politician recognised for his role in conservation, especially protection of the endangered species that is being part of the BIG 5." Ngqondi said that rhino poaching is a National Priority Crime and provincial government must continue to pursue strategies to fight poaching. "We want to applaud Premier Mabuyane for stepping up efforts which included traditional anti-poaching policing strategies and use of technology," he added. "Recognition is therefore given also to our law enforcement agencies under the command of the SAPS, within the extended Mission Area Joint Operations Centre (MAJOC) for their continued commitment to these anti-poaching efforts."
