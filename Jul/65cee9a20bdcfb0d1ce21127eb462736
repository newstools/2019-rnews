 King Williams Town - The African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape on Thursday said that it is shocked and numbed by the arrest of one of its Provincial office staff and a Ward Councillor of Matatiele Municipality over the past weekend on serious rape allegations. "The rape incidents happened separately as the staffer allegedly committed the act in Queenstown and the Councillor at Matatiele," said Gift Ngqondi, ANC Eastern Cape Provincial Head of Communications. "The suspects are still languishing in jail pending their bail applications. "The ANC once more confirms its confidence in the judicial system and encourage speedy resolution on the matter in the interest of justice." Ngqondi said that whilst the ANC holds the principle of innocent until proven otherwise, "we are firm in our view that rape is a very serious crime and cannot be tolerated in our society. We will provide support to the victims". "We call on our structures to mobilise our people in their respective communities to work with the police in the fight against the scourge of violating women and children through indecent and traumatizing acts of rape and violence," he added. "We call on men in our communities, in particular those active in our structures to take a stand against rape and violence. Let us hold hands with women in society towards this end. "Disciplinary processes will be instituted against the two members." Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
