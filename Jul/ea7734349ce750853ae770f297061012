 Mt Fletcher - Swift action and determination by the SAPS to rid the Province of widespread stock theft, led to the recovery of 25 livestock on Saturday in the Avondale Policing precinct at Mt Fletcher. "The sheep were reported stolen in the early hours of Saturday morning," said police spokesperson, Brig Tembinkosi Kinana. "During the Operation dubbed 'Restore' and as the police units were patrolling the area as part of crime prevention, they were informed of a number of sheep that were hidden underground nearby a local farm." He said that on arrival at the scene, they indeed found about 25 livestock hidden in the dark hole. "The sheep were later identified as belonging to a local farmer, who reported them stolen earlier in the day. "According to the owner of the sheep, when he woke up in the morning, he noticed that the sheep were no longer in the yard," Brig Kinana said. "He immediately realised that they might have been stolen. "During the investigation, Police subsequently recovered the livestock and handed them over to the lawful owner." He said that the investigation continues into the whereabouts of those responsible for the theft of the sheep. "No arrest made at this stage." Police are appealing to the members of the community to expose those responsible for stock theft within and around their villages. "They can do so by informing the local police station or call crime stop number 08 600 10 111. All the information supplied will be kept confidential," Brig Kinana added.
