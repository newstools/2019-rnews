 East London - Members of East London Flying Squad arrested two suspects for possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition after they received information about a suspicious vehicle driving in Quigney and intending to commit a robbery in the area. "They spotted the vehicle with three occupants and stopped it to conduct a search," described police spokesperson, Captain Hazel Mqala. "A 9mm pistol was found hidden under the front passenger’s seat. Two suspects, aged between 25 and 35, were subsequently arrested and taken to East London Police cells for detention." She said that while the case of possession of unlicensed firearm was being opened, a complainant from a shop at Station Street came to the Police Station to open a case of Business Robbery where the two suspects are implicated. "Both suspects are detained also for the Business Robbery," Capt Mqala said. "The firearm was then circulated and found to be a state firearm belonging to a TRT member at East London, who reported a case of burglary in May 2019 during which his service pistol was stolen. "All suspects will appear in the East London Magistrate’s Court soon." Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
