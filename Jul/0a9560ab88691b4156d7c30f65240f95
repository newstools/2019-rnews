 Thornhill - Humansdorp SAPS Cluster police officers intensified efforts to rid local streets of illicit drugs after 43 of the 73 suspects arrested last week were netted for possession of illicit drugs. "On Sunday, after midday, police received information about a maroon Opel Corsa bakkie that was allegedly transportating illicit drugs to Hankey," described police spokesperson, Sergeant Majola Nkohli. "At about 3pm, Thornhill police pulled off the road a bakkie fitting the same description on the N2. "During the search, police recovered drugs stashed behind a radio in a false compartment behind a dashboard." He said that drugs recovered were 330 mandrax tablets and several bankies of crystal meth (tik). "The total estimated street value of the drugs is R22 500." Sgt Nkohli said that the three occupants in the vehicle were arrested and a bakkie was confiscated for further investigation. "The men, aged between 28 and 35, all from Hankey are due to appear at the Humansdorp Magistrate’s Court on Monday on possession of mandrax and tik." He added that the trio is among the 73 people who were arrested in the Humansdorp Cluster during crime prevention operations last week. "43 of those were suspects that were arrested for possession of illicit drugs in the nine stations of the cluster. Other arrests were for offences such as drunk driving and menial offences such as drunk and disorderly."
