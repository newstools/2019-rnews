 East London - Almost every entrepreneur - at some point in their journey - considers going into franchising as a guaranteed route to attaining business success. “Despite the sector having a higher success rate compared to its counterparts, franchising has its pros and cons and will not necessarily be suitable for every entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs who are considering or have decided pursuing franchising as a business opportunity should perform due diligence to avoid making costly mistakes,” says Morne Cronje, Head of Franchising at FNB Business. He shares key factors that entrepreneurs should consider to determine if franchising suits their needs and business endeavours. This is also an opportunity for you to find out more about the business and the type of support you are likely to get from the franchisor. Funding requirements may differ depending on the type of franchise and whether it is a new setup, existing business being purchased or taken over from another bank. “Taking the above factors into account while doing additional research based on the franchise opportunity you want to pursue will go a long way to ensuring that you make a sound business decision,” concludes Cronje.
