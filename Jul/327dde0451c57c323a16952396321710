 East London - In an effort to keep local youths from criminal activities, Beacon Bay police, in East London, hosted a 'Boxing against Crime' tournament at Nompumelelo informal settlement over the weekend. "The target audience was the youth between the ages of 10 and 30 years of age," described police spokesperson, Captain Hazel Mqala. "The youth were encouraged not to do drugs or abuse alcohol, buying stolen goods and taking law into their hands, but to rather participate in sport. "There were 12 bouts of three rounds each." All participants received medals, while the winners received trophies and their clubs received boxing gear. "The campaign was well attended by the youth, SAPS East London Cluster Office, Safety and Liaison, SAPS Beacon Bay, CPF, Street Committees, NICRO, DSRAC and the Boxing Federations from East London," Captain Mqala added. "Approximately 200 spectators attended although the weather conditions were harsh with strong winds and low temperatures. "No incidents were reported."
