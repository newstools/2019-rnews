 Jeffreys Bay - The Kouga Local Municipality on Monday advised residents that power utility, Eskom, will be switching off power supply to almost all of the Kouga area on Wednesday, 14 August. Kouga Local Municipality Infrastructure & Engineering Portfolio Councillor, Freddy Campher, said the parastatal had notified the municipality that it would be switching off the power to the whole of Jeffreys Bay, Humansdorp, St Francis Bay, Cape St Francis, Oyster Bay, Hankey, Patensie and Loerie on the day. Areas that will NOT BE AFFECTED, are Thornhill and the Gamtoos River Mouth area, where the power is supplied by the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro Municipality. The interruption has been scheduled from 05:00 to 18:00. According to the notification, the interruption is necessary for new installation work and planned maintenance by Eskom. “We would like to remind residents that all electrical appliances must be treated as live during the down period,” Campher said. The shutdown is subject to the weather. A new date will be communicated if the work cannot go ahead on the day.
