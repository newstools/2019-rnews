 East London - With the election results from the 2019 National and Provincial trickling in, there are still many parties in the Eastern Cape that are yet to mark their presence felt on the scoreboard. The African National Congress (ANC) is currently maintaining a comfortable lead in the Eastern Cape in what has turned out mostly to be a three-horse race to the finish line. The Democratic Alliance (DA) is following behind and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) look set to keep their position as the province’s third biggest party. The United Democratic Movement (UDM) and new party - African Transformation Movement (ATM), currently complete the top five with 13 846 votes (1.84 % of the votes counted so far) for the UDM and 9 683 votes (1.29 %) for the ATM. However, at the time of publishing, there were many other parties that were in the race. Many of these smaller parties are yet to garner 1% of the votes cast in Wednesdays 2019 General Elections. The VF PLUS has 6 096 - or only 0.85 % of the votes; followed by the AFRICAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY (ACDP) at 3 328 (or 0.46% of the votes). Meanwhile the AFRICAN INDEPENDENT CONGRESS (AIC) has received 2 649 votes (0.37%); the PAN AFRICANIST CONGRESS OF AZANIA (PAC) has only 2 193 (or 0.31% of the vote). The GOOD party is a new kid on the block and has received 2 135 votes (0.30 % of the overall votes); the CONGRESS OF THE PEOPLE (COPE) which was once one of the biggest parties in the province has only 1 812 votes so far (or 0.25% of the counted votes).
