 Humansdorp - A 40-year-old Humansdorp man is expected in court on Monday after he was arrested by police over the weekend for the possession of suspected stolen diesel. "At about 00:01, on Saturday morning, alert Humansdorp SAPS members were busy with routine patrols in Bosbok Street in the industrial area of Humansdorp, when they noticed a vehicle parked on the side of the road," said police spokesperson, Captain Gerda Swart. "The officers questioned the driver, who informed them that the vehicle had a flat tyre and that he is working at the local Fire Department. "Members immediately followed their own instincts and looked into the matter.  Members discovered that the suspect had eight 25L plastic containers in the white Hyundai SUV." She said that the suspect could not give a sound reason for being in possession of the diesel containers, especially at that time of the night. "Members also recalled that various cases of theft out of motor vehicle were reported where diesel was stolen from the trucks at the Fire Department," Capt Swart. "Members arrested the 40-year-old male suspect on a charge of possession of suspected stolen goods. The estimated value of the recovered diesel amounts to R3 300. "It was later established that the suspect was working at the Fire Department." She added that the suspect is due to appear in the Humansdorp Magistrate's Court on Monday on the mentioned charge. "Humansdorp detectives are looking into the possibility to link the suspect to other cases." Humansdorp Cluster Commander, Brigadier John Lebok commended the members for their alertness and congratulated them for a sterling job.
