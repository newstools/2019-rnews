 Port Alfred - Eastern Cape Premier, Lubabalo Oscar Mabuyane, is on Tuesday expected to announce the appointment of members of the provincial executive Council (MECs) afternoon in Port Alfred. Mabuyane, who is also the African National Congress (ANC) Eastern Cape Chairperson, was elected unopposed and sworn in as the new Eastern Cape Premier on Wednesday last week after the ANC won the Eastern Cape. In South Africa, the Executive Council of a province is the cabinet of the provincial government. The Executive Council consists of the Premier and five to ten other members, who have the title 'Member of the Executive Council', commonly abbreviated to 'MEC'. MECs are appointed by the Premier from amongst the members of the provincial legislature; he or she can also dismiss them. The provincial legislature may force the Premier to reconstitute the council by passing a motion of no confidence in the Executive Council excluding the Premier. If the legislature passes a motion of no confidence in the Executive Council including the Premier, then the Premier and the MECs must resign. The Premier designates powers and functions to the MECs; conventionally they are assigned portfolios in specific areas of responsibility. They are accountable to the provincial legislature, both individually and as a collective, and must regularly report to the legislature on the performance of their responsibilities. The Western Cape, the only province to have adopted its own constitution, chose to call its executive council the 'Provincial Cabinet', and its MECs 'Provincial Ministers'. Premier Mabuyane will make the announcement of the MECs for the province at the Royal St Andrews Hotel, in Port Alfred, at around 3:00pm. The 5th administration -  the previous Eastern Cape cabinet, was constituted as follows:  It's anyone's guess as to who is in and who is out. The obvious ones are former Premier, Phumulo Masualle, who is now at the National Assembly as an African National Congress (ANC) MP and Pemmy Majodina, who is now the ANC's chief whip at the National Assembly. Helen Sauls-August was elected the new Speaker of the Eastern Cape Legislature - replacing former Premier-turned-Speaker, Noxolo Kiviet. Former Transport MEC, Thandiswa Marawu, in March announced her resignation from the ANC and joined new party, the African Transformation Movement (ATM).
