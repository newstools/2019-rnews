 Mthatha - Ten men, aged between 24 and 54 years old, are expected in court in Mthatha on Tuesday after they were arrested by Madeira Vispol and K9 members for public violence. According to police information, the men blocked the N2 highway, near Makhapetshwini, and prohibited other trucks loaded with building material to pass on Monday, at about 11h00. "Police tried to intervene, but a group of men threatened and ordered the driver of a white Isuzu FTR800 to torch the truck he was driving and pelted him and the police with stones," said police spokesperson, Captain Dineo Koena. "When police made a chase the truck drivers also attempted to drive towards police vans in an effort to cause attempted murder, but police managed to arrest 10 suspects. "Five trucks they were driving were confiscated as they were used in the commission of crime." She said that all the suspects will appear before Mthatha Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. "It is a great success and we cannot allow the perpetrators of crime to undermine our authority, we must always stamp the authority of the state," said the Acting Cluster Commander Brigadier Mandlakhe Twala.
