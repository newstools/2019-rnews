 Port Alfred - Two suspects are expected in court after they were arrested by Port Alfred police for possession of an illegal firearm over the weekend. "Disarming criminals of firearms is one of the goals that every officer strives to achieve daily," described police spokesperson, Capt Gerda Swart. She said that on Saturday, at approximately 21:00, the Station Commander of Moyeni SAPS was patrolling his area with another member when they come across a suspicious white Nissan Almera with four male occupants. "They stopped and during a search of the occupants and the vehicle, they found one firearm, a 9mm pistol with a magazine containing one round with the serial number filed off, under driver's seat," Capt Swart said. "Whilst busy apprehending the driver and passenger, the other two passengers ran off into nearby bushes - one of whom was the owner of the vehicle. "The suspects, aged 30 and 34, face charges of possession of unlicenced firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition." She added that the firearm, whose serial number was filed off, will be forwarded for ballistic testing to establish its ownership and whether it was involved in any other crimes. "Both suspects will appear in the local magistrate's court early this week. Port Alfred SAPS Cluster Commander, Brigadier Morgan Govender, commended the officer and the member for their vigilance and added, "your actions have foiled a criminal act from taking place.
