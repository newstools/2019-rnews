 Port Elizabeth - With Eastern Cape having the highest number of special votes applications, the provincial government, through the Provincial Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (ProvJOINTS) has commended the multi-disciplinary teams that worked tirelessly to ensure that stability prevailed across the Province. Though there were sporadic incidents of disruptions, the law enforcement agencies were swift to calm the situations to enable the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) officials to open polling stations where special votes were to be cast. Good work was done as well with regards to home visits by IEC officials to register the elderly, the sick and those who could not make the trip to the polling stations for one reason or the other. All state security agencies and police remain on high alert to quell any undue disruptions and such will be done without any fear or favour, said Provincial Commissioner Lt General Liziwe Ntshinga. "Our roving teams are on high alert to stamp the authority of the State within the confines of the law. We shall not hold back in arresting those who instigate violence, acts of criminality and cause disruption in the election processes," Lt General Ntshinga said. "No one has the right to prevent other people from exercising their Constitutional right to cast their votes."
