 Uitenhage - A 22-year-old man is expected in court on Monday after he was arrested in Kamesh, Uitenhage, by vigilant police officers on Sunday for possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. "On Sunday, at about 12:45am, members from Kamesh SAPS were patrolling in Pelican Street, when they spotted a man throwing something on the roadside and started running," described police spokesperson, Sgt Majola Nkohli. "Police chased him and caught the suspicious man in Grasvoel Street, Rosedale area, Uitenhage. "Police then took him to the scene, where he was seen throwing something." He said that, at the scene, police recovered a .38mm pistol with a live round of ammunition. "The suspect was arrested for possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition." He is due to appear in the Uitenhage Magistrate’s Court on Monday on charges of possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition. Sgt Nkohli said that a preliminary investigation has revealed that a firearm was stolen in Walmer, Port Elizabeth, in January this year. "The firearm is to be sent for forensic examination (ballistics) to determine whether it could be linked to any other violent serious crime. Police detectives are busy profiling him (suspect) for possible linkages to other serious crimes." Uitenhage acting Cluster Commander, Brigadier Ronald Koll, commended members for their alertness that led to the arrest. “Deployment of members in 'hot-spots' areas has some positive spin-offs. Alertness is key during visible police patrols,” added Brig Koll. Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
