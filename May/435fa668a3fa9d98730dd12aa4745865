 Port Elizabeth - The Port of Port Elizabeth has become the first port in Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) to achieve the International Organisation for Standardisation’s 45001 certification. The ISO 45001 is an international standard that specifies requirements for an occupational health and safety (OH&S) management system, with guidance for its use, to enable an organisation to proactively improve its OH&S performance in preventing injury and ill-health. ISO 45001 is the new ISO standard for OH&S. It has become one of the most eagerly awaited standards in the world, and is set to drastically improve levels of workplace safety. Rajesh Dana, Port Manager at the Port of PE said, “The port is proud to be the first port in the TNPA port system to be ISO 45001 certified. The certification reiterates the principle that safety is all of our responsibility. I not only commend the milestone that our SHE department has achieved, but also the entire port community. "ISO 45001 will allow us to control all factors that might result in illness, injury and in extreme cases death, by mitigating adverse effects on the physical, mental and cognitive condition of our employees, stakeholders and visitors, ensuring ZERO Harm.” There are many differences between the previously required OHSAS 18001 and ISO 45001 however, the main change concentrates on the interaction between the organisation and its business environment as opposed to OH&S hazards and other internal issues.
