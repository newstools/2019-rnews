 Port Elizabeth - The South Africa Social Security Agency (SASSA) says grant payment disruptions experienced on Wednesday have been resolved. "Some SASSA beneficiaries encountered problems yesterday when trying to withdraw their grants at the post office and through other payment channels," described SASSA Spokesperson, Paseka Letsatsi. "This was due to a network problem on the side of the South African Post Office (SAPO) grant payment system." He added that the grant money has been reversed into the affected beneficiaries’ accounts and is now available for withdrawal. SASSA is working together with all relevant stakeholders on its value chain to avoid a repeat of this situation in future. “We would like to sincerely apologise to the affected beneficiaries and their families for yesterday’s disruption in grant payments. SASSA and the Post Office are working on preventative measures to ensure that such a disruption does not occur in future- Abraham Mahlangu SASSA Acting CEO said. Beneficiaries are requested to direct further queries to the SASSA toll-free number (0800 60 10 11).
