 East London -  Transnet says it has managed to stop the strike action planned by South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (SATAWU) following a 48-hour notice for marine personnel to embark on a strike action from Wednesday night. The strike action was stopped through a court interdict obtained by Transnet on Wednesday afternoon. The strike action was as a result of an unresolved dispute of mutual interest that exists between Transnet National Port Authority (TNPA) Marine Personnel who are members of SATAWU. The Marine Personnel include Marine Pilots, Tug Masters and Chief Marine Engineering Officers and are responsible for a large part of operations in the port system. TNPA said that it remains committed in further engaging with SATAWU towards a resolution. Acting Chief Executive at TNPA Nozipho Mdawe said: “We would like to assure our customer and stakeholders of our commitment to provide a seamless service to the industry. TNPA management will be closely monitoring port operations and will try and prevent any potential disruptions to shipping movements.” The SATAWU strikealso threatened operations at Eastern Cape ports. SATAWU said that its members were set to go on strike at all of the country’s ports including Durban, Richards Bay, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Saldanha Bay, Mossel Bay and East London.
