 Port Elizabeth - The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape on Thursday offered a substantial reward for information on those allegedly defacing its 2019 national and provincial government elections posters. "Due to constant assaults on our posters, the DA is now announcing a cash reward of R50 000 for information on poster defacement, removal or interference, when such information leads to successful prosecution of the offender," said Andrew Whitfield MPL, DA Eastern Cape Provincial Chairperson. "Many of our posters, across the province, are being removed by criminal elements." Whitfield said that last month the party were informed of an EFF activist allegedly removing its election posters and burning them. "He was later arrested and appeared in court. It is a criminal offence to interfere with a party’s election posters in any way," he explained. "The Independent Electoral Commission has made it clear that, according to the electoral code of conduct, defacing political posters is one of the most serious offences. "If any person is found guilty of committing such crimes the perpetrators can face a fine or imprisonment of up to 10 years." Whitfield said that tips and evidence of poster interference can be sent to report@da.org.za. "These may be sent anonymously and are best prosecutable when photos or videos are sent too."
