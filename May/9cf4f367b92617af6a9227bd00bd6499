 Port Elizabeth - Mount Road Cluster Trio Detectives, in Port Elizabeth, are on the hunt for four male suspects, who allegedly broke into a house in Kleinskool and shot one of the occupants during an apparent house robbery on Tuesday night. "It is alleged that between 22:00 and 23:00, the complainant and two other people were inside a shack in Wimmer Street in Kleinskool when voices were heard from outside the shack," described police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "The complainant went to enquire what was going on and saw the four males standing outside the locked gate. "They pointed at him with a firearm and threatened him to open the gate. When entry was refused, a window was broken and the suspects entered." Col Naidu said that the three occupants inside the shack were assaulted and one of the suspects threw boiling water on a 36-year-old victim. "A 38-year-old male was also shot in his mouth and the third victim, a 23-year-old female, was hit over the head with a DVD player," she added. "The suspects left with four cell phones, a DVD player and a sound system. "The two victims were taken to hospital for treatment." Col Naidu said that police are investigating a case of house robbery and is appealing to anyone, who can assist in tracking down the suspects to contact D/Capt Chris Rowan on 082 442 1457 or their nearest police station.
