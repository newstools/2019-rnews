 Port Alfred - Two men escaped with only minor bruises after their boat capsized at the Kowie River Mouth in Port Alfred over the weekend. According to Stephen Slade, National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Port Alfred deputy station commander, at 11h15, on Sunday, the NSRI Port Alfred duty crew were activated following eye-witness reports of a boat capsized with two local men onboard at East Pier in the Kowie River Mouth. "Our sea rescue craft Lotto Challenger and Rescue 11 Alpha were launched and our sea rescue vehicle and Gardmed ambulance services responded," he added. "Both men had managed to get ashore and local surfers were assisting to try to recover the men's personal effects that had been ejected from the boat when it capsized. "With only minor and cuts and bruises they required no medical attention and we righted their boat and towed the casualty boat into the Kowie river harbour where their boat was recovered and no further assistance was required." Slade said that the eye-witnesses and the surfers, who assisted on the scene, are commended for their assistance.
