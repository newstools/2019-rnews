 Port Elizabeth -  The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Monday said that the Executive Mayor, Mongameli Bobani, has relieved Acting Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality City Manager, Peter Nielson, of his duties with immediate effect due to medical reasons. "Nielson will soon undergo a medical operation that will make him unable to perform his duties," explained Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Communications and Media Management Officer, Mthubanzi Mniki. "It is for this reason that the Executive Mayor has decided to appoint Mrs Noxolo Nqwazi to act as City Manager." Nqwazi is currently the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality's Executive Director for Arts, Sport, Recreation and Culture (ASRC). "A suitable official within ASRC will then be appointed to act in Mrs Nqwazi's position." Nielson was appointed in acting capacity after another Acting City Manager quitfollowing the suspension of Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality City Manager, Johann Mettler over apparent gross misconduct. The Demcratic Alliance (DA) protested Nielson's appointment saying it believes that Neilson also does not possess the minimum competency levels to occupy said office. Executive Mayor Bobani said: "I would like to thank Mr Nielson for the commitment he has shown while acting in this important position. I wish him all the best and good health".
