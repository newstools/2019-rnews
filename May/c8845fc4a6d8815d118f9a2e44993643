 Makhanda - The Makana Local Municipality on Thursday said that it notes the recent public statements made by Gift of the Givers regarding their interventions in the town of Makhanda and surrounding areas and their intention to withdraw from the town. "We wish to reassure the public that engagement with the Gift of the Givers is ongoing, with discussions taking place on an almost daily basis in an attempt to find a resolution on the issues," the municipality said. "Their announcement was made in the midst of those discussions and is, we believe, unfortunate in that the statement seems to be an attempt to influence those discussions and, further, is contrary to the positive spirit of engagement we’ve enjoyed with Gift of the Givers to date." The Makana Municipality said that there are some elements of the Gift of the Givers communication that need correction. It made the following response: "We hope that the current situation will be resolved in the best interests of the people of Makana, on whose behalf we act, and in a way that ensures that Gift of the Givers are compensated for their effort, expertise and care in our time of need."
