 Porrt Elizabeth - With 91.94 % of the vote counted in the Eastern Cape at the time of publishing, the election results show it is almost a foregone conclusion that the African National Congress (ANC) has retained the Eastern Cape province in Wednesday's 2019 National and Provincial elections. At the time of publishing, out of the 1 787 568 votes cast in the Eastern Cape on Wednesday, the ANC had received 1 225 132 votes so far (68.54 % of the votes) while the official opposition, the Democratic Alliance (DA) trailed behind with only 285 067 (15.95 %) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with 138 939 votes (7.77 %). The United Democratic Movement (UDM) was at position four with 47 053 votes (2.63 %) and a new party the African Transformation Movement (ATM) had made some inroads on its first try with 27 205 votes (1.52 %). At the time of publishing, these smaller parties were yet to make their presence felt and had failed to even get 1% of the votes cast in Wednesday's 2019 General Elections. The VF PLUS has 10 921 votes - or only 0.61 % of the votes; followed by the AFRICAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY (ACDP) at 8 398 (or 0.47 % of the votes). Meanwhile the AFRICAN INDEPENDENT CONGRESS (AIC) has received 7 625 votes (0.43%); the PAN AFRICANIST CONGRESS OF AZANIA (PAC) has only 7 121 (or 0.40% of the vote). The CONGRESS OF THE PEOPLE (COPE) which was once the official opposition in the Eastern Cape has only 4 580 votes so far (or 0.26% of the counted votes). Meanwhile, the ALLIANCE FOR TRANSFORMATION FOR ALL (ATA) got 4 527 (0.25%); the SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS PARTY (SRWP) - another new party,  got 4 502 votes (0.25%) so far. New party, GOOD, has received 4 372 votes (0.24% of the overall votes). Islamic party, AL JAMA-AH (ALJAMA), has received 2 752 (0.15%) of the votes counted so far while the AFRICAN PEOPLE'S CONVENTION (APC) got 2 290 (0.13%) votes.
