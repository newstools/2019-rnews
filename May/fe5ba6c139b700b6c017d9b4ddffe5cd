 Port Elizabeth - Day 1 of Special Voting successfully commenced in the Eastern Cape Province with home visits and voting station visits being undertaken. "A total number of 110 630 special vote applications were approved in the Eastern Cape," described the Electoral Commision's Julie Stanworth. The Eastern Cape received the highest number of special votes applications in the category of home visitations for this election. "The inclement weather has proven to be a challenge in some areas, particularly the area of Mazeppa Bay in the eastern region of the province where a river has flooded, making access to 3 voters for home visits to be a challenge," Stanworth said. "Alternative routes are being sourced and telephone contact with the voters has been made to assure them that every effort is being made to reach them, if not today, it will be tomorrow [Tuesday]." She added that there is contact communication being the disaster management team in the province and the IEC. "Within the Buffalo City Metro, 10 tent sites opened late due to being let down by the service provider," Stanworth said. "This substandard service by the contractor is being investigated, but assurance is given that tents have since been erected. "Where access to voting stations was hampered by service delivery protests the IEC is working closely with security forces who have assisted in getting the stations opened, albeit it slightly late in a few cases." She said that voters who applied for a special vote and received confirmation of acceptance are reminded that if they have not voted on Monday will either be visited at home if they applied for a home visit or are urged to visit their voting stations before 17h00 on Tuesday.
