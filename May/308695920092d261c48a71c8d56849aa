 Port Elizabeth - Four people, three women and one man, died on Tuesday morning in a shack fire in Malabar Ext 6, Port Elizabeth. "It is alleged that at about 05:45, the boyfriend of one of the deceased women left for work," said police spokesperson, Warrant Officer Alwin Labans. "When he left, he asked one of the women to lock the door behind him. "At about 06:15, neighbours heard frantic screams for help coming from the shack." He said that the entire shack was alight and the flames were too intense for anyone to save those inside the shack. "The deceased were identified as  Luchnene Crotz, 33-years old  and her son, Duwayne Crotz (8 years old) and her sister, Keesha Dolf (13 years old) as well as her friend,  Lee Ann Leslie, who was 17 years old." W/O Labans said that the cause of the fire is unknown at this stage and police have opened an inquest docket. "Police is also appealing to the community to assist them should they have any information regarding the incident," he added. "SAPS Gelvandale detectives may be contacted on 041 401 7000."
